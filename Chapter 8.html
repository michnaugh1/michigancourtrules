As part of this obligation, the court shall continue to take reasonable measures to avoid exposing participants in court proceedings, court employees, and the general public to COVID-19. Such measures include continuing to provide a method or methods for filers to submit pleadings and other filings other than by personal appearance at the court.

In addition, except when a court rule or statute specifies that the court or clerk of the court must provide certain forms without charge, the administrative order may allow the clerk to provide the forms at the cost of reproduction to the clerk.

(9) The delegation of such authority to a chief judge does not in any way limit the Supreme Court’s authority to exercise “general superintending control over all courts” under Const 1963, art 6, § 4.

(A) Local Court Rules.

(1) A trial court may adopt rules regulating practice in that court if the rules are not in conflict with these rules and regulate matters not covered by these rules.

(2) If a practice of a trial court is not specifically authorized by these rules, and

(a) reasonably depends on attorneys or litigants being informed of the practice for its effectiveness, or

(b) requires an attorney or litigant to do some act in relation to practice before that court, the practice, before enforcement, must be adopted by the court as a local court rule and approved by the Supreme Court.

(3) Unless a trial court finds that immediate action is required, it must give reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on a proposed local court rule to the members of the bar in the affected judicial circuit, district, or county. The court shall send the rule and comments received to the Supreme Court clerk.

(4) If possible, the number of a local court rule supplementing an area covered by these rules must correspond with the numbering of these rules and bear the prefix LCR. For example, a local rule supplementing MCR 2.301 should be numbered LCR 2.301.

(B) Administrative Orders.

(1) A trial court may issue an administrative order governing only internal court management.

(C) Use of Portable Electronic Devices in a Courthouse.

(1) Purpose. This rule specifies the permitted and prohibited uses of portable electronic devices in a courthouse. A court must use reasonable means to advise courthouse visitors of the provisions of this rule.

A portable electronic device may not be used, without permission of the court, to make or to receive telephone calls or for any other audible function while court is in session.

(D) Access to Court Proceedings.

(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or court rule, a court may not limit access by the public to a court proceeding unless

(a) a party has filed a written motion that identifies the specific interest to be protected, or the court sua sponte has identified a specific interest to be protected, and the court determines that the interest outweighs the right of access;

(b) the denial of access is narrowly tailored to accommodate the interest to be protected, and there is no less restrictive means to adequately and effectively protect the interest; and

(c) the court states on the record the specific reasons for the decision to limit access to the proceeding.

(2) Any person may file a motion to set aside an order that limits access to a court proceeding under this rule, or an objection to entry of such an order. MCR 2.119 governs the proceedings on such a motion or objection. If the court denies the motion or objection, the moving or objecting person may file an application for leave to appeal in the same manner as a party to the action.

(3) Whenever the court enters an order limiting access to a proceeding that otherwise would be public, the court must forward a copy of the order to the State Court Administrative Office.

Use of Case-Type Code. As required by MCR 1.109(D)(1)(b)(iii), the person filing a case initiating document must assign one case-type code from a list provided by the State Court Administrator according to the principal subject matter of the action (not the nature of the proceedings), and shall provide this code with other case initiation information required by MCR 1.109(D)(2). The case code must be included in the caption of all other documents filed in the case.

Rule 8.119 Court Records and Reports; Duties of Clerks
(A) Applicability. This rule applies to all records in every trial court. For purposes of this rule, records are as defined in MCR 1.109, MCR 3.218, MCR 3.903, and MCR 8.119(D)-(G).

(B) Records Standards. Trial courts shall comply with the records standards in this rule, MCR 1.109, and as prescribed by the Michigan Supreme Court.

(C) Filing of Documents and Other Materials. The clerk of the court shall process and maintain documents filed with the court as prescribed by Michigan Court Rules and the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and all filed documents must be file stamped in accordance with these standards. The clerk of the court may only reject documents submitted for filing that do not comply with MCR 1.109(D)(1) and (2), are not signed in accordance with MCR 1.109(E), or are not accompanied by a required filing fee or a request for fee waiver under MCR 2.002(B), unless already waived or suspended by court order. Documents prepared or issued by the court for placement in the case file are not subject to rejection by the clerk of the court and shall not be stamped filed but shall be recorded in the case history as required in subrule (D)(1)(a) and placed in the case file.

(D) Records Kept by the Clerk of the Court. The clerk of the court shall maintain the following case records in accordance with the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards. Documents and other materials made nonpublic or confidential by court rule, statute, or order of the court pursuant to subrule (I) must be designated accordingly and maintained to allow only authorized access. In the event of transfer or appeal of a case, every rule, statute, or order of the court under subrule (I) that makes a document or other materials in that case nonpublic or confidential applies uniformly to every court in Michigan, irrespective of the court in which the document or other materials were originally filed.

(1) Case History and Case Files. The clerk shall maintain records of each case consisting of case history (known as a register of actions) and, except for civil infractions, a case file in such form and style as may be prescribed by the State Court Administrative Office. Each case shall be assigned a case number on receipt of a case initiating document. The case number shall comply with MCR 1.109(D)(1)(b)(iii). In addition to the case number, a separate petition number shall be assigned to each petition filed under the juvenile code, MCL 712A.1 et seq., as required under MCR 1.109(D)(1)(d). The case number (and petition number if applicable) shall be recorded in the court’s automated case management system and on the case file. The records shall include the following characteristics:

(a) Case History. The clerk shall create and maintain a case history of each case, known as a register of actions, in the court’s automated case management system. The automated case management system shall be capable of chronologically displaying the case history for each case and shall also be capable of searching a case by number or party name (previously known as numerical and alphabetical indices) and displaying the case number, date of filing, names of parties, and names of any attorneys of record. The case history shall contain both pre- and post-judgment information and shall, at a minimum, consist of the data elements prescribed in the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards. Each entry shall be brief, but shall show the nature of each item filed, each item issued by the court, and the returns showing execution. The case history entry of each item filed shall be dated with the date of filing (if relevant) and the date and initials of the person recording the action, except where the entry is recorded by the electronic filing system. In that instance, the entry shall indicate that the electronic filing system recorded the action. The case history entry of each order, judgment, opinion, notice, or other item issued by the court shall be dated with the date of issuance and the initials of the person recording the action. Protected personal identifying information entered into the court’s case management system as required by MCR 1.109(D)(9)(e) shall be maintained for the purposes for which it was collected and for which its use is authorized by federal or state law or court rule; however, it shall not be included or displayed as case history, including when transferred to the Archives of Michigan pursuant to law.

(b) Case File. The clerk of the court shall maintain a file of each action, bearing the case number assigned to it, for all pleadings, process, written opinions and findings, orders, and judgments filed in the action, and any other materials prescribed by court rule, statute, or court order to be filed with the clerk of the court. If case file records are maintained separately from the case files, the clerk shall maintain them as prescribed by the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards.

(2) Calendars. The clerk may maintain calendars of actions. A calendar is a schedule of cases ready for court action that identifies times and places of activity.

(3) Abolished Records.

(a) Journals. Except for recording marriages, journals shall not be maintained.

(b) Dockets. Case history replaces a docket. Wherever these rules or applicable statutes require entries on a docket, those entries shall be entered in the court’s automated case management system.

(4) Official Court Record. There is only one official court record, regardless whether original or suitable-duplicate and regardless of the medium. Suitable-duplicate is defined in the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards. Documents electronically filed with the court or generated electronically by the court are original records and are the official court record. A paper printout of any electronically filed or generated document is a copy and is a nonrecord for purposes of records retention and disposal.

(E) Other Case Records. The clerk or other persons designated by the chief judge of the court shall maintain in the manner prescribed by these rules, other materials filed with or handled by the court for purposes of case processing, including but not limited to wills filed for safekeeping, case evaluations, exhibit logs, presentence reports, probation files, problem-solving court treatment files, financial statements for collections, and friend of the court records.

(F)   Court Recordings, Log Notes, Jury Seating Charts, and Media. Court recordings, log notes, jury seating charts, and all other records such as tapes, backup tapes, discs, and any other medium used or created in the making of a record of proceedings and kept pursuant to MCR 8.108 are court records and are subject to access in accordance with subrule (H)(8)(b).

(G)   Other Court Records. All court records not included in subrules (D), (E), and (F) are considered administrative and fiscal records or nonrecord materials and are not subject to public access under subrule (H). These records are defined in the approved records retention and disposal schedule for trial courts.

(H)   Access to Records. Except as otherwise provided in subrule (F), only case records as defined in subrule (D) are public records, subject to access in accordance with these rules.

(1) The clerk shall not permit any case record to be taken from the court without the order of the court.

(2) A court may provide access to the public case history information through a publicly accessible website, and business court opinions may be made available as part of an indexed list as required under MCL 600.8039.

(3) Public access to all electronic documents imported from an electronic document management system maintained by a court or its funding unit to the state-owned electronic document management system maintained by the State Court Administrative Office will be automatically restricted until protected personal identifying information is redacted from all documents with a filed date or issued date that precedes April 1, 2022.

(4) If a request is made for a public record that is maintained electronically, the court is required to provide a means for access to that record. However, the records cannot be provided through a publicly accessible website if protected personal identifying information has not been redacted from those records.

(5) If a public document prepared or issued by the court on or after April 1, 2022, or a Uniform Law Citation filed with the court on or after April 1, 2022, contains protected personal identifying information, the information must be redacted before it can be provided to the public, whether the document is provided upon request via a paper or electronic copy, or direct access via a publicly accessible computer at the courthouse. Upon receipt by the court on or after April 1, 2022, protected personal identifying information included in a proposed order shall be protected by the court as required under MCR 8.119(H) as if the document was prepared or issued by the court.

(6) The court may provide access to any case record that is not available in paper or digital image, as defined by MCR 1.109(B), if it can reasonably accommodate the request. Any materials filed with the court pursuant to MCR 1.109(D), in a medium for which the court does not have the means to readily access and reproduce those materials, may be made available for public inspection using court equipment only. The court is not required to provide the means to access or reproduce the contents of those materials if the means is not already available.

(7) Unless access to a case record or information contained in a record as defined in subrule (D) is restricted by statute, court rule, or an order entered pursuant to subrule (I), any person may inspect that record and may obtain copies as provided in subrule (J). In accordance with subrule (J), the court may collect a fee for the cost of providing copies.

(8) Every court shall adopt an administrative order pursuant to MCR 8.112(B) to

(a) make reasonable regulations necessary to protect its public records and prevent excessive and unreasonable interference with the discharge of its functions;

(b) establish a policy for whether to provide access for records defined in subrule (F) and if access is to be provided, outline the procedure for accessing those records;

(c) specify the reasonable cost of reproduction of records provided under subrule (J); and

(d) specify the process for determining costs under subrule (J).

(9) Set Aside Convictions. Information on set aside convictions is nonpublic and access is limited to a court of competent jurisdiction, an agency of the judicial branch of state government, the department of corrections, a law enforcement agency, a prosecuting attorney, the attorney general, and the governor upon request and only for the purposes identified in MCL 780.623. Access may also be provided to the individual whose conviction was set aside, that individual’s attorney, and the victim(s) as defined in MCL 780.623. The court must redact all information related to the set aside conviction or convictions before making the case record available to the public in any format.

(I) Sealed Records.

(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or court rule, a court may not enter an order that seals courts records, in whole or in part, in any action or proceeding, unless

(a) a party has filed a written motion that identifies the specific interest to be protected,

(b) the court has made a finding of good cause, in writing or on the record, which specifies the grounds for the order, and

(c) there is no less restrictive means to adequately and effectively protect the specific interest asserted.

(2) In determining whether good cause has been shown, the court must consider,

(a) the interests of the parties, including, where there is an allegation of domestic violence, the safety of the alleged or potential victim of the domestic violence, and

(b) the interest of the public.

(3) The court must provide any interested person the opportunity to be heard concerning the sealing of the records.

(4) Materials that are subject to a motion to seal a record in whole or in part must be made nonpublic temporarily pending the court’s disposition of the motion.

(5) For purposes of this rule, “court records” includes all documents and records of any nature that are filed with or maintained by the clerk in connection with the action.

(6) A court may not seal a court order or opinion, including an order or opinion that disposes of a motion to seal the record.

(7) Whenever the court grants a motion to seal a court record, in whole or in part, the court must forward a copy of the order to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and to the State Court Administrative Office.

(8) Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the court’s authority to issue protective orders pursuant to MCR 2.302(C) without a motion to seal or require that a protective order issued under MCR 2.302(C) be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court and the State Court Administrative Office. A protective order issued under MCR 2.302(C) may authorize parties to file materials under seal in accordance with the provisions of the protective order without the necessity of filing a motion to seal under this rule.

(9) Any person may file a motion to set aside an order that disposes of a motion to seal the record, to unseal a document filed under seal pursuant to MCR 2.302(C), or an objection to entry of a proposed order. MCR 2.119 governs the proceedings on such a motion or objection. If the court denies a motion to set aside the order or enters the order after objection is filed, the moving or objecting person may file an application for leave to appeal in the same manner as a party to the action. See MCR 8.116(D).

(J) Access and Reproduction Fees.

(1)   A court may not charge a fee to access public case history information or to retrieve or inspect a case document irrespective of the medium in which the case record is retained, the manner in which access to the case record is provided (including whether a record is retained onsite or offsite), and the technology used to create, store, retrieve, reproduce, and maintain the case record.

(2) A court may charge a reproduction fee for a document pursuant to MCL600.1988, except when required by law or court rule to provide a copy without charge to a person or other entity.

(3)   The court may provide access to its public case records in any medium authorized by the records reproduction act, 1992 PA 116; MCL 24.401 to 24.403.

(4)   Reproduction of a case document means the act of producing a copy of that document through any medium authorized by the records reproduction act, 1992 PA 116; MCL 24.401 to 24.403.

(a)   A court may charge only for the actual cost of labor and supplies and the actual use of the system, including printing from a public terminal, to reproduce a case document and not the cost associated with the purchase and maintenance of any system or technology used to store, retrieve, and reproduce the document.

(b)   If a person wishes to obtain copies of documents in a file, the clerk shall provide copies upon receipt of the actual cost of reproduction.

(c)   Except as otherwise directed by statute or court rule, a standard fee may be established, pursuant to (H)(8), for providing copies of documents on file.

(5)   A court is not required to create a new record out of its existing records. A new record means the compilation of information into a format that does not currently exist or that cannot be generated electronically using predefined formats available through a court’s case management system. Providing access to documents or furnishing copies of documents in an existing file does not constitute creation of a new record, even when the output appears in a format different than the format of the original record or document because the output is the result of predefined formats.

(a)   A court may create a new record or compilation of records pertaining to case files or case-related information on request, provided that the record created or compiled does not disclose information that would otherwise be confidential or restricted by statute, court rule, or an order entered pursuant to subrule (I).

(b)   A court may charge only for the actual cost of labor and supplies and the actual use of the system to develop, generate, and validate the accuracy of a new record and not the cost associated with the purchase and maintenance of any system or technology used to store, retrieve, and reproduce the information or documents for creating a new record.

(c)   If a court creates a new record, the clerk shall provide access to the new record upon receipt of the actual cost of creating the record.

(K)   Retention Periods and Disposal of Court Records.

For purposes of retention, the records of the trial courts include: (1) administrative and fiscal records, (2) case file and other case records, (3) court recordings, log notes, jury seating charts, and recording media, and (4) nonrecord material. The records of the trial courts shall be retained in the medium prescribed by MCR 1.109. The records of a trial court may not be disposed of except as authorized by the records retention and disposal schedule and upon order by the chief judge of that court. Before disposing of records subject to the order, the court shall first transfer to the Archives of Michigan any records specified as such in the Michigan trial courts approved records retention and disposal schedule. An order disposing of court records shall comply with the retention periods established by the State Court Administrative Office and approved by the state court administrator, Attorney General, State Administrative Board, Archives of Michigan, and Records Management Services of the Department of Management and Budget, in accordance with MCL 399.811.

(L) Reporting Duties.

(1) The clerk of every court shall submit reports and records as required by statute and court rule.

(2) The clerk of every court shall submit reports or provide records as required by the State Court Administrative Office, without costs.

Rule 8.120 Law Students and Recent Graduates; Participation in Legal Aid Clinics, Defender Offices, and Legal Training Programs
(A) Legal Aid Clinics; Defender Offices. Effective legal service for each person in Michigan, regardless of that person’s ability to pay, is important to the directly affected person, to our court system, and to the whole citizenry. Law students and recent law graduates, under supervision by a member of the state bar, may staff public and nonprofit defender offices, and legal aid clinics that are organized under a city or county bar association or an accredited law school or for the primary purpose of providing free legal services to indigent persons.

(B) Legal Training Programs. Law students and recent law graduates may participate in legal training programs organized in the offices of county prosecuting attorneys, county corporation counsel, city attorneys, municipal/township attorneys, the Attorney Grievance Commission, and the Attorney General.

(C) Eligible Students. A student in a law school approved by the American Bar Association who has received a passing grade in law school courses and has completed the first year is eligible to participate in a clinic or program listed in subrules (A) and (B) if the student meets the academic and moral standards established by the dean of that school. For the purpose of this rule, a “recent law graduate” is a person who has graduated from law school within the last year. The student or graduate must certify in writing that he or she has read and is familiar with the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct and the Michigan Court Rules, and shall take an oath which is reasonably equivalent to the Michigan Lawyer’s Oath in requiring at a minimum the promise to: (a) support the Constitution of the United States; (b) support the Constitution of the State of Michigan; (c) maintain the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers; (d) never seek to mislead a judge or jury by any artifice or false statement of fact or law; (e) maintain the confidence and preserve inviolate the secrets of the client; (f) abstain from all offensive personality; (g) advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness, unless required by the justice of the cause; and (h) in all other respects conduct himself or herself personally and professionally in conformity with the high standards of conduct imposed upon members of the state bar of Michigan.

(D) Scope; Procedure.

(1) A member of the legal aid clinic, in representing an indigent person, is authorized to advise the person and to negotiate and appear on the person’s behalf in all Michigan courts except the Supreme Court. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the indigent person that will be assisted by the student must consent in writing to the representation. In a situation in which a law student provides short-term, limited-scope legal advice by telephone in the context of a clinical program intended to assist indigent persons offered as part of a law school curriculum, the clinic patron shall be informed that:

(a)   the advice provided may be rendered by a law student, and

(b)   by proceeding to the consultation following notification that the advice may be provided by a law student, the clinic patron consents to such representation.

(2) Representation must be conducted under the supervision of a state bar member. Supervision by a state bar member includes the duty to examine and sign all pleadings filed. It does not require the state bar member to be present

(a) while a law student or graduate is advising an indigent person or negotiating on the person’s behalf, or

(b) during a courtroom appearance of a law student or graduate, except

   (i) during an appellate argument or

   (ii) in a criminal or juvenile case exposing the client to a penalty of imprisonment.

The supervising attorney shall assume all personal professional responsibility for the student’s or graduate’s work, and should consider purchasing professional liability insurance to cover the practice of such student or graduate.

(3) A law student or graduate may not appear in a case in a Michigan court without the approval of the judge or a majority of the panel of judges to which the case is assigned. If the judge or a majority of the panel grants approval, the judge or a majority of the panel may suspend the proceedings at any stage if the judge or a majority of the panel determines that the representation by the law student or graduate

(a) is professionally inadequate, and

(b) substantial justice requires suspension.

Rule 8.121 Contingent Fees in Claims or Actions for Personal Injury, Wrongful Death, and No-Fault Benefits
(A) Allowable Contingent Fee Agreements. In any claim or action for personal injury or wrongful death based upon the alleged conduct of another or for no-fault benefits, in which an attorney enters into an agreement, expressed or implied, whereby the attorney’s compensation is dependent or contingent in whole or in part upon successful prosecution or settlement or upon the amount of recovery, the receipt, retention, or sharing by such attorney, pursuant to agreement or otherwise, of compensation which is equal to or less than the fee stated in subrule (B) is deemed to be fair and reasonable. The receipt, retention, or sharing of compensation which is in excess of such a fee shall be deemed to be the charging of a “clearly excessive fee” in violation of MRPC 1.5(a), unless such fee is received as a result of an award of attorney fees payable pursuant to MCL 500.3148, or other award or sanction made pursuant to statute, court rule, or the common law.

(B) Maximum Fee. The maximum allowable fee for the claims and actions referred to in subrule (A) is one-third of the amount recovered.

(C) Computation.

(1) The amount referred to in subrule (B) shall be computed on the net sum recovered after deducting from the amount recovered all disbursements properly chargeable to the enforcement of the claim or prosecution of the action. In computing the fee, the costs as taxed and any interest included in or upon the amount of a judgment shall be deemed part of the amount recovered.

(2) In the case of a settlement payable in installments, the amount referred to in subrule (B) shall be computed using the present value of the future payments.

(a) If an annuity contract will be used to fund the future payments, “present value” is the actual cost of purchasing the annuity contract. The attorney for the defendant must disclose to the court and the parties the amount paid for the annuity contract, after any rebates or other discounts.

(b) If the defendant will make the future payments directly, “present value” is the amount that an entity of the same financial standing as the defendant would pay for an annuity contract. The court may appoint an independent expert to certify the “present value” as defined in this paragraph. The court may base its findings on the expert’s testimony or affidavit.

(D) Agreements for Lower Fees. An attorney may enter into contingent fee arrangements calling for less compensation than that allowed by subrule (B).

(E) Advice to Client. An attorney must advise a client, before entering into a contingent fee arrangement, that attorneys may be employed under other fee arrangements in which the attorney is compensated for the reasonable value of the services performed, such as on an hourly or per diem basis. The method of compensation used by an individual attorney remains the attorney’s option, and this rule does not require an attorney to accept compensation in a manner other than that chosen by the attorney.

(F) Agreements to be in Writing. Contingent fee arrangements made by an attorney with a client must be in writing and a copy provided to the client.

(G) Applicability. This rule does not apply to agreements reduced to writing before May 3, 1975. The one-third provision of subrule (B) applies to contingent fee agreements entered into after July 9, 1981. Earlier agreements are subject to the rule in effect at the time the agreement was made.

Rule 8.122 Claims by Clients Against Attorneys
Attorneys are officers of Michigan’s one court of justice and are subject to the summary jurisdiction of the court. The circuit court of the county in which an attorney resides or maintains an office has jurisdiction, on verified written complaint of a client, and after reasonable notice and hearing, to enter an order for the payment of money or for the performance of an act by the attorney which law and justice may require. All courts have like jurisdiction over similar complaints regarding matters arising from actions or proceedings in those courts.

Rule 8.126 Temporary Admission to the Bar
(A) Temporary Admission. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an out of state attorney may seek temporary admission as determined by this subsection. Any person who is licensed to practice law in another state or territory, or in the District of Columbia, of the United States of America, or in any foreign country, and who is not disbarred or suspended in any jurisdiction, and who is eligible to practice in at least one jurisdiction, may be permitted to appear and practice in a specific case in a court, before an administrative tribunal or agency, or in a specific arbitration proceeding in this state when associated with and on motion of an active member of the State Bar of Michigan who appears of record in the case. An out-of-state attorney may be temporarily admitted to practice under this rule in no more than five cases in a 365-day period. Permission to appear and practice is within the discretion of the court, administrative tribunal or agency, or arbitrator and may be revoked at any time for misconduct. For purposes of this rule, an out-of-state attorney is one who is licensed to practice law in another state or territory, or in the District of Columbia, of the United States of America, or in a foreign country and who is not a member of the State Bar of Michigan.

(1) Procedure.

(a) Motion. An attorney seeking temporary admission must be associated with a Michigan attorney. The Michigan attorney with whom the out-of-state attorney is associated shall file with the court or administrative tribunal or agency, or arbitrator an appearance and a motion that seeks permission for the temporary admission of the out-of-state attorney. The motion shall be supported by a current certificate of good standing issued by a jurisdiction where the out-of-state attorney is licensed and eligible to practice, the document supplied by the State Bar of Michigan showing that the required fee has been paid and an affidavit of the out-of-state attorney seeking temporary admission, which affidavit shall verify

(i) the jurisdictions in which the attorney is or has been licensed or has sought licensure;

(ii) the jurisdiction where the attorney is presently eligible to practice;

(iii) that the attorney is not disbarred, or suspended in any jurisdiction, and is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action, and that the attorney is licensed and is in good standing in all jurisdictions where licensed; and

(iv) that he or she is familiar with the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct, Michigan Court Rules, and the Michigan Rules of Evidence.

The out-of-state attorney must attach to the affidavit copies of any disciplinary dispositions. The motion shall include an attestation of the Michigan attorney that the attorney has read the out-of-state attorney’s affidavit, has made a reasonable inquiry concerning the averments made therein, believes the out-of-state attorney’s representations are true, and agrees to ensure that the procedures of this rule are followed. The motion shall also include the addresses and email addresses of both attorneys.

(b) Fee. In each case in which an out-of-state attorney seeks temporary admission in Michigan, the out-of-state attorney must pay a fee equal to the discipline and client-protection portions of a bar member’s annual dues. The fee must be paid electronically to the State Bar of Michigan, in conjunction with submission of an electronic copy of the motion, the certificate of good standing and the affidavit to the State Bar of Michigan, pursuant to procedures established by the State Bar of Michigan. Upon receipt of the fee remitted electronically, confirmation of payment will issue electronically to the out-of-state attorney through the State Bar of Michigan’s automated process.

Within seven days after receipt of the copy of the motion and fee, the State Bar of Michigan must notify the court, administrative tribunal or agency, or arbitrator and both attorneys whether the out-of-state attorney has been granted permission to appear temporarily in Michigan within the past 365 days, and, if so, the number of such appearances. The notification will be issued electronically, pursuant to the procedures established by the State Bar of Michigan. No order or other writing granting permission to appear in a case shall be entered by a court, administrative tribunal or agency, or arbitrator until the notification is received from the State Bar of Michigan.

The State Bar of Michigan shall retain the discipline portion of the fee for administration of the request for temporary admission and disciplinary oversight and allocate the client-protection portion to the Client Protection Fund. If a request for investigation is filed with the grievance administrator against an attorney while temporarily admitted to practice in Michigan, the entire amount of the administration fee paid by that attorney for the case in which the allegations of misconduct arose would be transferred to the disciplinary system.

(c) Order. Following notification by the State Bar of Michigan, if the out-of-state attorney has been granted permission to appear temporarily in fewer than 5 cases within the past 365 days, the court, administrative tribunal or agency, or arbitrator may enter an order granting permission to the out-of-state attorney to appear temporarily in a case. If an order or other writing granting permission is entered, The Michigan attorney shall submit an electronic copy of the order or writing to the State Bar of Michigan within seven days.

(d) By seeking permission to appear under this rule, an out-of-state attorney consents to the jurisdiction of Michigan’s attorney disciplinary system.

(B) Waiver. An applicant is not required to associate with local counsel, limited to the number of appearances to practice, or required to pay the fee to the State Bar of Michigan, if the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the court in which the attorney seeks to appear that:

(1) the applicant appears for the limited purpose of participating in a child custody proceeding as defined by MCL 712B.3(b) in a Michigan court pursuant to the Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act, MCL 712B.1 et seq.; and

(2) the applicant represents an Indian tribe as defined by MCL 712B.3; and

(3) the applicant presents an affidavit from the Indian child’s tribe asserting the tribe’s intent to intervene and participate in the state court proceeding, and averring the child’s membership or eligibility for membership under tribal law; and

(4) the applicant presents an affidavit that verifies:

(a) the jurisdictions in which the attorney is or has been licensed or has sought licensure;

(b) the jurisdiction where the attorney is presently eligible to practice;

(c) that the attorney is not disbarred, or suspended in any jurisdiction, is not the subject of any pending disciplinary action, and that the attorney is licensed and is in good standing in all jurisdictions where licensed; and

(d) that he or she is familiar with the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct, Michigan Court Rules, and the Michigan Rules of Evidence.

(5) If the court in which the attorney seeks to appear is satisfied that the out of state attorney has met the requirements in this subrule, the court shall enter an order authorizing the out of state attorney’s temporary admission.
