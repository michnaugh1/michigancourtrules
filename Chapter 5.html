Rule 5.121 Guardian Ad Litem; Visitor
(A) Appointment.

(D) Evidence.

(1) Reports, Admission Into Evidence. Oral and written reports of a guardian ad litem or visitor may be received by the court and may be relied on to the extent of their probative value, even though such evidence may not be admissible under the Michigan Rules of Evidence.

(E) Attorney-Client Privilege.

(1) During Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. When the guardian ad litem appointed to represent the interest of a person is an attorney, that appointment does not create an attorney-client relationship. Communications between that person and the guardian ad litem are not subject to the attorney-client privilege. The guardian ad litem must inform the person whose interests are represented of this lack of privilege as soon as practicable after appointment. The guardian ad litem may report or testify about any communication with the person whose interests are represented.

(2) Later Appointment as Attorney. If the appointment of the guardian ad litem is terminated and the same individual is appointed attorney, the appointment as attorney creates an attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client privilege relates back to the date of the appointment of the guardian ad litem.

(B) Procedure.

Except in small estates under MCL 700.3982 and MCL 700.3983, the person responsible for serving a document in a decedent estate, guardianship, or conservatorship in which a demand for notice is filed is responsible for providing copies of any orders and filings pertaining to the proceeding in which the demandant has requested notification. If no proceeding is pending at the time the demand is filed, the court must notify the petitioner or applicant at the time of filing that a demand for notice has been filed and of the responsibility to provide notice to the demandant.

(2) Rights and Obligations of Demandant.

(a) The demandant must serve on interested persons a copy of a demand for notice filed after a proceeding has been commenced.

(b) Unless the demand for notice is limited to a specified class of documents, the demandant is entitled to receive copies of all orders and filings subsequent to the filing of the demand.

If venue for a proceeding to appoint a guardian for an individual with a developmental disability who is in a facility is questioned, and it appears that the convenience of the individual with a developmental disability or guardian would not be served by proceeding in the county where the individual with a developmental disability was found, venue is proper in the county where the individual with a developmental disability most likely would reside if not disabled. In making its decision, the court shall consider the situs of the property of the individual with a developmental disability and the residence of relatives or others who have provided care.

Subchapter 5.300 Proceedings In Decedent Estates
Rule 5.301 Applicability
The rules in this subchapter apply to decedent estate proceedings other than proceedings provided by law for small estates under MCL 700.3982.

Rule 5.302 Commencement of Decedent Estates
(A) Methods of Commencement. A decedent estate may be commenced by filing an application for an informal proceeding or a petition for a formal testacy proceeding. A request for supervised administration may be made in a petition for a formal testacy proceeding.

(1) When filing either an application or petition to commence a decedent estate, two copies of the death certificate must be filed with the application or petition. If the death certificate is not available, the petitioner may file two copies of alternative documentation of the decedent’s death. In either instance, the petitioner must redact from one of the copies being filed all protected personal identifying information as required by MCR 1.109(D)(9). The unredacted copy of the death certificate or alternative documentation must be maintained by the court as a nonpublic record.

(2) If a will that is being filed with the court for the purposes of commencing an estate contains protected personal identifying information, the filer must provide the will being filed for probate and a copy that has the protected personal identifying information redacted as required by MCR 1.109(D)(9).The unredacted version of the will must be maintained by the court as a nonpublic record.
(3) Where electronic filing is implemented, if the application or petition to commence a decedent estate indicates that there is a will, it is available, and that it is not already in the court’s possession, an exact copy of the will and any codicils must be attached to the application or petition. Within 14 days of the filing of the application or petition, the original will and any codicils must be filed with the court or the case will be dismissed without notice and hearing. Notice of a dismissal for failure to file the original will and any codicils shall be served on the petitioner and any interested persons in a manner provided under MCR 5.105(B).

(4) The court is prohibited from requiring additional documentation, such as information about the proposed or appointed personal representative.

(B) Testimony Identifying Heirs Form. At least one completed SCAO-approved testimony identifying heirs and devisees must be submitted with the application or petition that commences proceedings. A testimony identifying heirs form must be verified under MCR 1.109(D)(3).

(C) Preservation of Testimony. If a hearing is held, proofs included as part of the record are deemed preserved for further administration purposes.

(D) Petition by Parent of Minor. In the interest of justice, the court may allow a custodial parent who has filed an appearance to file a petition to commence proceedings in a decedent estate on behalf of a minor child where the child is an interested person in the estate.

The personal representative must, not later than 14 days after appointment, serve notice of appointment by personal service or by first-class mail as provided in MCL 700.3705 and the agreement and notice relating to attorney fees required by MCR 5.313(D). No notice of appointment need be served if the person serving as personal representative is the only person to whom notice must be given.

Determination of heirs is also required whenever supervised administration is requested. No other petition for a formal proceeding, including a petition to appoint a personal representative which does not request formal probate of a will or adjudication of intestacy, need contain a request for determination of heirs. The personal representative or an interested person may at any time file a petition for determination of heirs. Heirs may only be determined in a formal hearing.

(2) Determination Without Estate Administration.

(A) Denial of Application. If the probate register denies the application for informal probate or informal appointment, the applicant may file a petition for a formal proceeding, which may include a request for supervised administration.

(B) Effect of Form of Administration in Another State or Country. The fact that any particular form of administration has been initiated in the estate of a decedent in another state or country does not preclude any other form of proceedings with respect to that decedent in Michigan without regard to the form of the proceeding in the other state or country.

(C) Notice of Intent to Seek Informal Appointment as Personal Representative.

(1) A person who desires to be appointed personal representative in informal proceedings must serve notice of intent to seek appointment and a copy of the application on each person having a prior or equal right to appointment who does not renounce this right in writing before the appointment is made.

(2) Service of notice of intent to seek appointment and a copy of the application must be made at least 14 days by mail or 7 days by personal service before appointment as personal representative.

(A) Applicability. The other rules applicable to decedent estates apply to supervised administration unless they conflict with this rule.

(B) Commencement of Supervised Administration. A request for supervised administration in a decedent estate may be made in the petition for formal testacy and appointment proceedings. A petition for formal testacy and appointment proceedings including a request for supervised administration may be filed at any time during the estate proceedings if testacy has not previously been adjudicated. If testacy and appointment have been previously adjudicated, a separate petition for supervised administration may be filed at any time during administration of the estate. Whenever supervised administration is requested, the court must determine heirs unless heirs were previously determined, even if supervised administration is denied.

(C) Filing Documents With the Court. The personal representative must file the following additional documents with the court and serve copies on the interested persons:

(1) Inventory. The personal representative must file an inventory as prescribed by MCR 5.307(A).

A final account must be filed when the estate is ready for closing or on removal of a personal representative. The court may order an interim accounting at any time the court deems necessary.

(b) Accounting Period. The accounting period ends on the anniversary date of the issuance of the letters of authority or, if applicable, on the anniversary date of the close of the last period covered by an accounting.

(c) Contents. All accountings must be itemized, showing in detail receipts and disbursements during the accounting period, unless itemization is waived by all interested persons. A written description of services performed must be included or appended regarding compensation sought by a personal representative. This description need not be duplicated in the order. The accounting must include notice that (i) objections concerning the accounting must be brought to the court's attention by an interested person because the court does not normally review the accounting without an objection; (ii) interested persons have a right to review proofs of income and disbursements at a time reasonably convenient to the personal representative and the interested person; (iii) interested persons may object to all or part of an accounting by filing an objection with the court before allowance of the accounting; and (iv) if an objection is filed and not otherwise resolved, the court will hear and determine the objection.

(d) Proof of Income and Disbursements. After filing and before the allowance of an accounting, the personal representative must make proofs of income and disbursements reasonably available for examination by any interested person who requests to see them or as required by the court. An interested person, with or without examination of the proofs of income and disbursements, may file an objection to an accounting with the court. If an interested person files an objection without examining the proofs and the court concludes that such an examination would help resolve the objection, the court may order the interested person to examine the proofs before the court hears the objection.

(a) if a federal estate tax return was required to be filed for the decedent, proof from the Michigan Department of Treasury that all Michigan estate taxes have been paid, or

(b) if no federal estate tax return was required to be filed for the decedent, a statement that no Michigan estate tax is due.

(E) Notice to Personal Representative. When supervised administration is ordered, the court must serve a written notice of duties on the personal representative. The notice must be substantially as follows:

“Inventories: You are required to file an inventory of the assets of the estate within 91 days of the date of your letters of authority or as ordered by the court. The inventory must list in reasonable detail all the property owned by the decedent at the time of death, indicating, for each listed item, the fair market value at the time of decedent's death and the type and amount of any encumbrance. If the value of any item has been obtained through an appraiser, the inventory should include the appraiser's name and address with the item or items appraised by that appraiser.

“Accountings: You are required to file annually, or more often if the court directs, a complete itemized accounting of your administration of the estate, showing in detail all the receipts and disbursements and the property remaining in your hands together with the form of the property.

(F) Changing from Supervised to Unsupervised Administration. At any time during supervised administration, any interested person or the personal representative may petition the court to terminate supervision of administration. The court may terminate supervision unless the court finds that proceeding with supervision is necessary under the circumstances. Termination of supervision does not discharge the personal representative.

(G) Approval of compensation of an attorney must be sought pursuant to MCR 5.313.

(H) Order of Complete Estate Settlement. An estate being administered in supervised administration must be closed under MCL 700.3952, using the procedures specified in MCR 5.311(B)(1).

A personal representative who files such a petition with the court must also file the documents described in MCR 5.310(C) and (D), as applicable, proofs of service of those documents that are required to be served on interested persons, and such other documents as the court may require. The court may order the personal representative discharged if the court is satisfied that the personal representative has properly administered the estate.

(4) Other Requests for Relief. With respect to other requests for relief, the petitioner must file appropriate documents to support the request for relief.

(5) Order. If the estate administration is completed, the order entered under MCL 700.3952 or MCL 700.3953 shall, in addition to any other relief, terminate the personal representative's authority and close the estate.

For good cause and without notice, the register may reopen the estate, appoint the former personal representative or a person who has priority, and issue letters of authority with a specified termination date.

(B) Reopening by Petition. The previously appointed personal representative or an interested person may file a petition with the court to reopen the estate and appoint a personal representative under MCL 700.3959.

(C) Calculation of Due Dates. For purposes of determining when the inventory fee calculation, the inventory filing, the inventory fee payment, and the notice of continued administration are due, a reopened decedent estate is to be treated as a new case.

(A) Reasonable Fees and Costs. An attorney is entitled to receive reasonable compensation for legal services rendered on behalf of a personal representative, and to reimbursement for costs incurred in rendering those services.

Rule 5.401 General Provisions
This subchapter governs guardianships, conservatorships, and protective order proceedings. The other rules in chapter 5 also apply to these proceedings unless they conflict with rules in this subchapter. Except as modified in this subchapter, proceedings for guardianships of adults and minors, conservatorships, and protective orders shall be in accordance with the Estates and Protected Individuals Code, 1998 PA 386 and, where applicable, the Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act, MCL 712B.1 et seq., the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 USC 1901 et seq., or the Mental Health Code, 1974 PA 258, as amended.

(B) Petition by Minor. A petition and a nomination for the appointment of a guardian or conservator of a minor may be executed and made by a minor 14 years of age or older.

(C) Responsibility for Giving Notice; Manner of Service. The petitioner is responsible for giving notice of hearing. Regardless of statutory provisions, an interested person may be served the notice by mail, personal service, or when necessary, publication. However, if the person who is the subject of the petition is 14 years of age or older, notice of the initial hearing must be served on the person personally unless another method of service is specifically permitted in the circumstances.

(D) Letters of Authority. After entering an order appointing a fiduciary, the court must issue letters of authority after an acceptance of appointment is filed, and if ordered, the filing of the fiduciary’s bond. The letters of authority shall be issued on a form approved by the state court administrator. Any restriction or limitation of the powers of a guardian or conservator must be set forth in the letters of authority.

(E)   Indian Child; Definitions, Jurisdiction, Notice, Transfer, Intervention.

(1)   If an Indian child, as defined by the Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act, is the subject of a guardianship proceeding, the definitions in MCR 3.002 shall control.

(2)   If an Indian child is the subject of a petition to establish guardianship of a minor and an Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction as defined in MCR 3.002(6), the matter shall be dismissed.

(3)   If an Indian child is the subject of a petition to establish guardianship of a minor and an Indian tribe does not have exclusive jurisdiction as defined in MCR 3.002(6), the court shall ensure that the petitioner has given notice of the proceedings to the persons prescribed in MCR 5.125(A)(8) and (C)(20) in accordance with MCR 5.109(1).

(a)   If either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child’s tribe petitions the court to transfer the proceeding to the tribal court, the court shall transfer the case to the tribal court unless either parent objects to the transfer of the case to tribal court jurisdiction or the court finds good cause not to transfer. When the court makes a good-cause determination under MCL 712B.7, adequacy of the tribe, tribal court, or tribal social services shall not be considered. A court may determine that good cause not to transfer a case to tribal court exists only if the person opposing the transfer shows by clear and convincing evidence that either of the following applies:

(i)   The Indian tribe does not have a tribal court.

(ii)   The requirement of the parties or witnesses to present evidence in tribal court would cause undue hardship to those parties or witnesses that the Indian tribe is unable to mitigate.

(b)   The court shall not dismiss the matter until the transfer has been accepted by the tribal court.

(c)   If the tribal court declines transfer, the Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act applies, as do the provisions of these rules that pertain to an Indian child (see MCL 712B.3 and MCL 712B.5).

(d)   A petition to transfer may be made at any time in accordance with MCL 712B.7(3).

For good cause stated on the record and included in the order, the court may shorten the period for notice of hearing or may dispense with notice of a hearing for the appointment of a temporary guardian of a minor, except that the minor shall always receive notice if the minor is 14 years of age or older. If a temporary guardian is appointed following an ex parte hearing in a case in which the notice period was shortened or eliminated, the court shall send notice of the appointment to all interested persons. The notice shall inform the interested persons about their right to object to the appointment, the process for objecting, and the date of the next hearing, if any. If an interested person objects to the appointment of a temporary guardian following an ex parte hearing in a case in which the notice period was shortened or eliminated, the court shall hold a hearing on the objection within 14 days from the date the objection is filed.

(C) Temporary Guardian for Incapacitated Individual Where no Current Appointment; Guardian Ad Litem. A petition for a temporary guardian for an alleged incapacitated individual shall specify in detail the emergency situation requiring the temporary guardianship. For the purpose of an emergency hearing, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem unless such appointment would cause delay and the alleged incapacitated individual would likely suffer serious harm if immediate action is not taken. The duties of the guardian ad litem are to visit the alleged incapacitated individual, report to the court and take such other action as directed by the court. The requirement of MCL 700.5312(1) that the court hold the fully noticed hearing within 28 days applies only when the court grants temporary relief.

(D) Temporary Guardian for Minor.

(1) Before Appointment of Guardian. If necessary during proceedings for the appointment of a guardian for a minor, the court may appoint a temporary guardian after a hearing at which testimony is taken. The petition for a temporary guardian shall specify in detail the conditions requiring a temporary guardianship. Where a petition for appointment of a limited guardian has been filed, the court, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, shall take into consideration the limited guardianship placement plan in determining the powers and duties of the parties during the temporary guardianship.

The temporary guardian shall determine whether a petition to remove the guardian should be filed. If such a petition is not filed, the temporary guardian shall report to court with recommendations for action that the court should take in order to protect the minor upon expiration of the term of the temporary guardian. The report shall be filed within 1 month of the date of the expiration of the temporary guardianship.

Rule 5.404 Guardianship of Minor
(A) Petition for Guardianship of Minor.

(1) Petition. A petition for guardianship of a minor shall be filed on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office. The petitioner shall state in the petition whether or not the minor is an Indian child or whether that fact is unknown. The petitioner shall document all efforts made to determine a child’s membership or eligibility for membership in an Indian tribe and shall provide them, upon request, to the court, Indian tribe, Indian child, Indian child’s lawyer-guardian ad litem, parent, or Indian custodian.

(2)    Investigation. Upon the filing of a petition, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of a minor and may order the Department of Health and Human Services or a court employee or agent to conduct an investigation of the proposed guardianship and file a written report of the investigation in accordance with MCL 700.5204(1). If the petition involves an Indian child, the report shall contain the information required in MCL 712B.25(1). The report shall be filed with the court and served no later than 7 days before the hearing on the petition. If the petition for guardianship states that it is unknown whether the minor is an Indian child, the investigation shall include an inquiry into Indian tribal membership.

(3)    Guardianship of an Indian Child. If the petition involves an Indian child and both parents intend to execute a consent pursuant to MCL 712B.13 and these rules, the court shall proceed under subrule (B). If the petition involves an Indian child and a consent will not be executed pursuant to MCL 712B.13 and these rules, the petitioner shall state in the petition what active efforts were made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family as defined in MCR 3.002(1). The court shall proceed under subrule (C).

(4) Social History. The petitioner must file a social history before a hearing is held on a petition for guardianship of a minor and shall do so on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office. The social history for minor guardianship is confidential, and it is not to be released, except on order of the court, to the parties or the attorneys for the parties.

(5)   Limited Guardianship of the Child of a Minor. On the filing of a petition for appointment of a limited guardian for a child whose parent is an unemancipated minor, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the minor parent. A limited guardianship placement plan is not binding on the minor parent until consented to by the guardian ad litem.

(B)   Voluntary Consent to Guardianship of an Indian Child.

A voluntary consent to guardianship of an Indian child must be executed by both parents or the Indian custodian.

(1)   Form of Consent. To be valid, the consent must contain the information prescribed by MCL 712B.13(2) and be executed on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office, in writing, recorded before a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction, and accompanied by the presiding judge's certificate that the terms and consequences of the consent were fully explained in detail and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify that either the parent or Indian custodian fully understood the explanation in English or that it was interpreted into a language that the parent or Indian custodian understood. Any consent given before, or within 10 days after, the birth of the Indian child is not valid. The court may use videoconferencing technology for the guardianship consent hearing required to be held under MCL 712B.13(1) and this subrule.

(2)   Hearing. The court must conduct a hearing on a petition for voluntary guardianship of an Indian child in accordance with this rule before the court may enter an order appointing a guardian. Notice of the hearing on the petition must be sent to the persons prescribed in MCR 5.125(A)(8) and (C)(20) in compliance with MCR 5.109(1). At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine:

(a)   if the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction as defined in MCR 3.002(6). The court shall comply with MCR 5.402(E)(2).

(b)   that a valid consent has been executed by both parents or the Indian custodian as required by MCL 712B.13 and this subrule.

(c)   if it is in the Indian child’s best interest to appoint a guardian.

(d)   if a lawyer-guardian ad litem should be appointed to represent the Indian child.

(3)   Withdrawal of Consent. A consent may be withdrawn at any time by sending written notice to the court substantially in compliance with a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office. Upon receipt of the notice, the court shall immediately enter an ex parte order terminating the guardianship and returning the Indian child to the parent or Indian custodian except, if both parents executed a consent, both parents must withdraw their consent or the court must conduct a hearing within 21 days to determine whether to terminate the guardianship.

(C)   Involuntary Guardianship of an Indian Child.

(1)   Hearing. The court must conduct a hearing on a petition for involuntary guardianship of an Indian child in accordance with this rule before the court may enter an order appointing a guardian. Notice of the hearing must be sent to the persons prescribed in MCR 5.125(A)(8) and (C)(20) in compliance with MCR 5.109(1). At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine:

(a)   if the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction as defined in MCR 3.002(6). The court shall comply with MCR 5.402(E)(2).

(b)   if the placement with the guardian meets the placement requirements in subrule (C)(2) and (3).

(c)   if it is in the Indian child’s best interest to appoint a guardian.

(d)   if a lawyer-guardian ad litem should be appointed to represent the Indian child.

(e)   whether or not each parent wants to consent to the guardianship if consents were not filed with the petition. If each parent wants to consent to the guardianship, the court shall proceed in accordance with subrule (B).

(2)   Placement. An Indian child shall be placed in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family and in which his or her special needs, if any, may be met. The child shall be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home, taking into account any special needs of the child. Absent good cause to the contrary, the placement of an Indian child must be in descending order of preference with:

(a)   a member of the child’s extended family,

(b)   a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the child’s tribe,

(c)   an Indian foster family licensed or approved by the Department of Health and Human Services,

(d)   an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs.

The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements above shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.

(3)   Deviating from Placement. The court may order another placement for good cause shown in accordance with MCL 712B.23(3)-(5) and 25 USC 1915(c). If the Indian child’s tribe has established a different order of preference than the order prescribed in subrule (C)(2), placement shall follow that tribe’s order of preference as long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in MCL 712B.23(6). Where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered.

(D)   Hearing. If the petition for guardianship of a minor does not indicate that the minor is an Indian child as defined in MCR 3.002(12), the court must inquire if the child or either parent is a member of an Indian tribe. If the child is a member or if a parent is a member and the child is eligible for membership in the tribe, the court shall either dismiss the petition or allow the petitioner to comply with MCR 5.404(A)(1).

(E) Limited Guardianship Placement Plans and Court-Structured Plans.

(1) All limited guardianship placement plans and court-structured plans shall at least include provisions concerning all of the following:

(a) visitation and contact with the minor by the parent or parents sufficient to maintain a parent and child relationship;

(b) the duration of the guardianship;

(a)   The parties to a limited guardianship placement plan may file a proposed modification of the plan without filing a petition. The proposed modification shall be substantially in the form approved by the state court administrator.

(b)   The court shall examine the proposed modified plan and take further action under subrules (c) and (d) within 14 days after the filing of the proposed modified plan.

(c)   If the court approves the proposed modified plan, the court shall endorse the modified plan and notify the interested persons of its approval.

(d)   If the court does not approve the modification, the court either shall set the proposed modification plan for a hearing or notify the parties of the objections of the court and that they may schedule a hearing or submit another proposed modified plan.

(F) Evidence.

(1)   Involuntary Guardianship of an Indian Child. If a petition for guardianship involves an Indian child and the petition was not accompanied by a consent executed pursuant to MCL 712B.13 and these rules, the court may remove the Indian child from a parent or Indian custodian and place that child with a guardian only upon clear and convincing evidence that:

(a)   active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family,

(b)   these efforts have proved unsuccessful, and

(c)   continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

The evidence shall include the testimony of at least one qualified expert witness, as described in MCL 712B.17, who has knowledge about the child-rearing practices of the Indian child’s tribe. The active efforts must take into account the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child’s tribe. If the petitioner cannot show active efforts have been made, the court shall dismiss the petition and may refer the petitioner to the Department of Health and Human Services for child protective services or to the tribe for services.

   (2) Reports, Admission Into Evidence. At any hearing concerning a guardianship of a minor, all relevant and material evidence, including written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied on to the extent of their probative value, even though such evidence may not be admissible under the Michigan Rules of Evidence.

   (3) Written Reports, Review and Cross-Examination. Interested persons shall be afforded an opportunity to examine and controvert written reports so received and, in the court's discretion, may be allowed to cross-examine individuals making reports when such individuals are reasonably available.

   (4) Privilege, Abrogation. No assertion of an evidentiary privilege, other than the privilege between attorney and client, shall prevent the receipt and use of materials prepared pursuant to a court-ordered examination, interview, or course of treatment.

(G) Review of Guardianship for Minor.

(1) Periodic Review. The court shall conduct a review of a guardianship of a minor annually in each case where the minor is under age 6 as of the anniversary of the qualification of the guardian. The review shall be commenced within 63 days after the anniversary date of the qualification of the guardian. The court may at any time conduct a review of a guardianship as it deems necessary.

(2) Investigation. The court shall appoint the Department of Health and Human Services or any other person to conduct an investigation of the guardianship of a minor. The investigator shall file a written report with the court within 28 days after such appointment. The report shall include a recommendation regarding whether the guardianship should be continued or modified and whether a hearing should be scheduled. If the report recommends modification, the report shall state the nature of the modification.

(3) Judicial Action. After informal review of the report, the court shall enter an order continuing the guardianship or set a date for a hearing to be held within 28 days. If a hearing is set, an attorney may be appointed to represent the minor.

(H) Termination of Guardianship.

(1) Necessity of Order. A guardianship may terminate without order of the court on the minor's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority or in accordance with subrule (H)(6). No full, testamentary, or limited guardianship shall otherwise terminate without an order of the court.

(3) Petition for Family Division of Circuit Court to Take Jurisdiction. If the court appoints an attorney or the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate whether to file a petition with the family division of circuit court to take jurisdiction of the minor, the attorney or Department of Health and Human Services shall, within 21 days, report to the court that a petition has been filed or why a petition has not been filed.

(a) If a petition is not filed with the family division, the court shall take such further action as is warranted, except the guardianship may not be continued for more than one year after the hearing on the petition to terminate.

(b) If a petition is filed with the family division, the guardianship shall terminate when the family division authorizes the petition under MCL 712A.11, unless the family division determines that continuation of such guardianship pending disposition is necessary for the well-being of the child.

(4) Resignation of Limited Guardian. A petition by a limited guardian to resign shall be treated as a petition for termination of the limited guardianship. The parents or the sole parent with the right to custody may file a petition for a new limited guardianship. If the court does not approve the new limited guardianship or if no petition is filed, the court may proceed in the manner for termination of a guardianship under section 5209 or 5219 of the Estates and Protected Individuals Code, MCL 700.5209 or MCL 700.5219.

The court may issue on its own initiative, or any party may secure, a subpoena to compel the preparer of the report to testify.

(2) Abrogation of Privilege. A report ordered by the court may be used in guardianship proceedings without regard to any privilege.
