MICHIGAN COURT RULES OF 1985

Chapter 4. District Court
Updated November 2, 2023 

Subchapter 4.000 General Provisions
Rule 4.001 Applicability
The rules in this chapter apply to the specific types of proceedings within the jurisdiction of the district and municipal courts. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, proceedings under this chapter are governed by Michigan Court Rules.

Rule 4.002 Transfer of Actions From District Court to Circuit Court
(A) Counterclaim or Cross-Claim in Excess of Jurisdiction.

(1) If a defendant asserts a counterclaim or cross-claim seeking relief of an amount or nature beyond the jurisdiction or power of the district court in which the action is pending, and accompanies the notice of the claim with a statement verified in the manner prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3) indicating that the defendant is justly entitled to the relief demanded, the clerk shall record the pleadings and present them to the judge to whom the action is assigned. The judge shall either order the action transferred to the circuit court to which appeal of the action would ordinarily lie or inform the defendant that transfer will not be ordered without a motion and notice to the other parties.

(2) Transfer of summary proceedings to recover possession of premises is governed under MCR 4.201(G)(2) and 4.202(I)(4) and subrules (C) and (D) of this rule.

(B) Change in Conditions.

(1) A party may, at any time, file a motion with the district court in which an action is pending, requesting that the action be transferred to circuit court. The motion must be supported by a statement verified in the manner prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3) indicating that

(a) due to a change in condition or circumstance, or

(b) due to facts not known by the party at the time the action was commenced, the party wishes to seek relief of an amount or nature that is beyond the jurisdiction or power of the court to grant.

(2) If the district court finds that the party filing the motion may be entitled to the relief the party now seeks to claim and that the delay in making the claim is excusable, the court shall order the action transferred to the circuit court to which an appeal of the action would ordinarily lie.

(C) Order for Transfer; Case Records.

(1) The district court must enter all necessary orders pertaining to the certification and transfer of the action to the circuit court. The district court must order the moving party to pay the applicable statutory filing fee directly to the circuit court, unless fees have been waived in accordance with MCR 2.002.

(2) The district court may also order the party seeking transfer to pay the opposing parties the costs they have reasonably incurred up to that time that would not have been incurred if the action had originally been brought in circuit court.

(3) The district court must serve the order on the parties and send a copy to the circuit court. The clerk of the district court must prepare the case records for transfer in accordance with the orders entered under subrule (1) and the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and send them to the receiving court by a secure method.

(4) The circuit court shall temporarily suspend payment of the filing fee and open a case pending payment of the filing fee and costs as ordered by the district court. The circuit court must notify the moving party of the new case number in the circuit court, the amount due, and the due date.

(5) After transfer, no further proceedings may be conducted in the district court, and the action shall proceed in the circuit court. The circuit court may order further pleadings and set the time when they must be filed.

(D) Payment of Filing and Jury Fees After Transfer; Payment of Costs.

(1) The party that moved for transfer must pay to the circuit court within 28 days of the date of the transfer order the applicable filing fee as ordered by the district court. No further action may be had in the case until payment is made. If the fee is not paid to the circuit court within 28 days of the date of the transfer order, the circuit court will either dismiss the counterclaim or cross-claim or order the case transferred back to the district court.

(2) If the jury fee has been paid, the clerk of the district court must forward it to the clerk of the circuit court to which the action is transferred as soon as possible after the case records have been transferred. If the amount paid to the district court for the jury fee is less than the circuit court jury fee, then the party requesting the jury shall pay the difference to the circuit court.

(3) If the court ordered payment of costs, the moving party must pay them to the opposing parties within 28 days of the date of the transfer order. If the costs are not paid within 28 days of the date of entry, the circuit court will either dismiss the counterclaim or cross-claim and/or order the case transferred back to the district court to proceed on the original claim.

(5) Default.

(a) If the defendant fails to appear on the date and time noticed by the summons, the court, on the plaintiff’s motion, may enter a default and may hear the plaintiff’s proofs in support of judgment if

(i) personal service of process was made on the residential defendant under MCR 2.105, or service of process was made on the residential defendant under MCR 4.201(D) and the court mailed a second copy of the initial summons and complaint in a court envelope and a record was kept pursuant to subrule (D), or service of process was made on the commercial defendant under MCR 4.201(D); or

(iv) the defendant appears on the date and time noticed by the summons but fails to appear on the date and time in which the trial was adjourned under subrule (K)(1).

(b) If satisfied that the complaint has met pleading and proof requirements and a default may enter under subrule (G)(5)(a), the court must enter a default judgment under MCL 600.5741 and in accordance with subrule (L). The default judgment must be mailed to the defendant by the court clerk and must inform the defendant that, if applicable,

(i) he or she may be evicted from the premises;

(ii) he or she may be liable for a money judgment.

(c) If the plaintiff fails to appear, a default judgment as to costs under MCL 600.5747 may be entered.

(d) If a default is not entered and the case is not otherwise resolved, the court must adjourn the trial for at least 7 days but not more than 14 days, unless a jury demand is made under subrule (G)(4) or good cause is shown under subrule (K)(1)(c). If the trial is adjourned, the court must mail notice of the new date to the party who failed to appear.

(H) Claims and Counterclaims.

(1) Joinder.

(a) A party may join:

(i) A money claim or counterclaim described by MCL 600.5739. A money claim must be separately stated in the complaint. A money counterclaim must be labeled and separately stated in a written answer.

(ii) A claim or counterclaim for equitable relief.

(b) Unless service of process under MCR 2.105 was made on the defendant, a money claim must be

(i) dismissed without prejudice, or

(ii) adjourned until service of process is complete if the defendant does not appear or file an answer to the complaint.

(c) A court with a territorial jurisdiction which has a population of more than 1,000,000 may provide, by local rule, that a money claim or counterclaim must be tried separately from a claim for possession unless joinder is allowed by leave of the court pursuant to subrule (H)(1)(e).

(d) If trial of a money claim or counterclaim

(i) might substantially delay trial of the possession claim, or

(ii) requires that the premises be returned before damages can be determined, the court must adjourn the trial of the money claim or counterclaim to a date no later than 28 days after the time expires for issuing an order of eviction. A party may file and serve supplemental pleadings no later than 7 days before trial, except by leave of the court.

(e) If adjudication of a money counterclaim will affect the amount the defendant must pay to prevent issuance of an order of eviction, that counterclaim must be tried at the same time as the claim for possession, subrules (H)(1)(c) and (d) notwithstanding, unless it appears to the court that the counterclaim is without merit.

(2) Removal.

(a) A summary proceedings action need not be removed from the court in which it is filed because an equitable defense or counterclaim is interposed.

(b) If a money claim or counterclaim exceeding the court's jurisdiction is introduced, the court, on motion of either party or on its own initiative, shall order, in accordance with the procedures in MCR 4.002, removal of that portion of the action to the circuit court, if the money claim or counterclaim is sufficiently shown to exceed the court's jurisdictional limit.

(I) Interim Orders. On motion of either party, or by stipulation, for good cause, a court may issue such interim orders as are necessary, including, but not limited to the following:

(1) Injunctions. The interim order may award injunctive relief

(a) to prevent the person in possession from damaging the property; or

(b) to prevent the person seeking possession from rendering the premises untenantable or from suffering the premises to remain untenantable.

(2) Escrow Orders.

(a) If trial is adjourned more than 14 days and the plaintiff shows a clear need for protection, the court may order the defendant to pay a reasonable rent for the premises from the date the escrow order is entered, including a pro rata amount per day between the date of the order and the next date rent ordinarily would be due. In determining a reasonable rent, the court should consider evidence offered concerning the condition of the premises or other relevant factors. The order must provide that:

(i) payments be made to the court clerk within 7 days of the date of entry of the order, and thereafter within 7 days of the date or dates each month when rent would ordinarily be due, until the right to possession is determined;

(ii) the plaintiff must not interfere with the obligation of the defendant to comply with the escrow order; and

(iii) if the defendant does not comply with the order, the defendant waives the right to a jury trial only as to the possession issue, and the plaintiff is entitled to an immediate trial within 14 days which may be by jury if a party requests it and if, in the court's discretion, the court's schedule permits it. The 14-day limit need not be rigidly adhered to if the plaintiff is responsible for a delay.

(b) Only the court may order the disbursement of money collected under an escrow order. The court must consider the defendant's defenses. If trial was postponed to permit the premises to be repaired, the court may condition disbursement by requiring that the repairs be completed by a certain time. Otherwise, the court may condition disbursement as justice requires.

(3) Stay of Proceedings.
(a) In cases filed pursuant to MCL 600.5714(1)(a) for nonpayment of rent due under a residential lease or agreement, the court must stay further proceedings after advising the defendant of the rights and information listed in subrule (K)(2)(a) and adjourning the trial under subrule (K). The court must not proceed to judgment if the defendant has applied for rental assistance from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, local Coordinated Entry Agency, Housing Assessment and Resource Agency or federal Help for Homeless Veterans program and provides written proof to the court that the application has been submitted for processing not later than five days after the defendant is verbally informed as provided in subrule (K)(2)(a) or (b). The State Court Administrative Office may provide a form to evidence this requirement.

(b) The initial stay is lifted after 14 days unless the defendant demonstrates to the court that the application is still pending or has been approved and rental assistance will be received. The total stay period under this subrule must not exceed 28 days and is automatically lifted 28 days from the date that the initial stay of the proceedings began.

(J) Consent Judgment When Party Is Not Represented. The following procedures apply to consent judgments and orders entered when either party is not represented by an attorney.

(1) The judgment or order may not be enforced until 3 regular court business days have elapsed after the judgment or order was entered. The judge shall review, in court, a proposed consent judgment or order with the parties, and shall notify them of the delay required by this subrule at the time the terms of the consent judgment or order are placed on the record.

(2) A party who was not represented by an attorney at the time of the consent proceedings may move to set aside the consent judgment or order within the 3-day period. Such a motion stays the judgment or order until the court decides the motion or dismisses it after notice to the moving party.

(3) The court shall set aside a consent judgment or order on a satisfactory showing that the moving party misunderstood the basis for, or the rights which were being relinquished in, the judgment or order.

(K) Trial.

(1) Time.

(a) If, after advising the defendant of the rights and information listed in subrule (K)(2)(a) the court adjourns the trial, it must be scheduled at least 7 days but not more than 14 days after the initial date and time set for trial noticed by the summons, unless a jury demand is made under subrule (G)(4) or good cause is shown under subrule (K)(1)(c).

(b) After advising the defendant of the rights and information listed in subrule (K)(2)(a), the court must decide remaining pretrial motions and determine if there is a triable issue. If there is no triable issue, the court must enter judgment.

(c) The court may try the action pursuant to subrule (K), or, if good cause is shown, may adjourn trial up to 56 days. If the court adjourns trial for more than 14 days, an escrow order may be entered pursuant to subrule (I)(2). The parties may adjourn trial by stipulation in writing or on the record, subject to the approval of the court.

(2) Conducting the Trial.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in subrule (K)(2), at the initial date and time set for trial noticed by the summons, the court must verbally inform the parties of the following rights and information:

(i) The right to an attorney under subrule (G)(2).

(ii) The right to proper venue under subrule (G)(3).

(iii) The right to demand a jury trial under subrule (G)(4).

(iv) In cases filed pursuant to MCL 600.5714(1)(a) for nonpayment of rent due under a residential lease or agreement, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, local Coordinated Entry Agency, Housing Assessment and Resource Agency, or federal Help for Homeless Veterans program may be able to assist with payment of some or all of the rent due. Within five days of receiving the advice of rights and information under this subrule, the defendant must provide written proof to the court that an application for assistance has been submitted for processing under subrule (I)(3).

(v) In cases filed pursuant to MCL 600.5714(1)(a) for nonpayment of rent due under a residential lease or agreement, defendants do not need a judgment to receive assistance from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, local Coordinated Entry Agency, or Housing Assessment and Resource Agency. The summons and complaint from the court case are sufficient for help from the state.

(vi) The availability of the Michigan and local community dispute resolution program office as a possible source of case resolution.

(vii) The possibility of a conditional dismissal pursuant to MCR 2.602 if approved by all parties. The parties must be provided with a form to effectuate such conditional dismissal or direct the parties to the location of the SCAO approved form online. 

If the defendant does not appear for trial on the date and time noticed by the summons and a default was not entered, the court must verbally inform the parties of the information in this subrule at the defendant’s first appearance and allow the defendant time to make a jury demand under subrule (G)(4) and to retain an attorney under subrule (G)(2).

(b) Courts may provide advice of rights consistent with SCAO guidance to an individual or group of defendants via video, computer presentation, or other technological means so long as the court ensures that each defendant is present for the entire presentation. If a defendant was previously provided advice of rights by the court, whether via a group presentation or individually, the court is not required to again provide a full advice of rights but must, on the record, ensure that the defendant received a full advice of rights, understood the advice of rights, and ask if defendant has any questions about the advice of rights.

(c) If authorized by statutory amendment, a district court magistrate may advise the defendant of the rights and information in subrule (K)(2)(a).

(d) Unless otherwise provided in this rule, at the date and time set for trial and after verbally advising the parties of the rights and information under subrule (K)(2)(a), the court shall adjourn the trial as provided in subrule (K)(1).

(e) Unless otherwise provided in this rule, immediately following the advice of rights and information required by subrule (K)(2)(a), the court may resolve the case without adjourning the trial, if any of the following occur:

(i) The plaintiff dismisses the complaint, with or without prejudice, and without any conditions.

(ii) The residential defendant is personally served under MCR 2.105(A), service of process was made on the residential defendant under subrule (D) and the court mailed a second copy of the initial summons and complaint in a court envelope and a record was kept pursuant to subrule (D) and fails to appear at the date and time set for trial noticed by the summons under subrule (K)(2)(a), or the commercial defendant is served under subrule (D) and fails to appear at the date and time set for trial noticed by the summons under subrule (K)(2)(a).

(iii) Both plaintiff and defendant are represented by counsel, and a consent judgment or conditional dismissal is filed with the court.

(iv) The parties enter into a consent judgment or conditional dismissal on the record after knowingly and voluntarily waiving the rights identified in subrule (K)(2)(a) and the adjournment required by subrule (K)(2)(d). The court must review the defendant’s waiver of rights and the terms of the consent judgment or conditional dismissal. After adequate inquiry, if the court determines that a valid waiver exists and the terms are fair, it may enter the consent judgment or conditional dismissal on the record. A defendant who has consulted with an attorney either in person or remotely after receiving the summons and who is waiving these rights is presumed to have knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights identified in subrule (K)(2)(a).

(v) any of the circumstances listed in subrule (G)(5)(a)(ii), except for an action in which MCL 600.5714(1)(b) applies, is pleaded and proved, with notice, sufficient to meet the statutory requirements. Actions in which MCL 600.5714(1)(b) apply shall be heard pursuant to MCL 600.5735(7).

(3) Government Reports. If the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to comply with an ordinance or statute, the court may admit an authenticated copy of any relevant government employee’s report filed with a government agency. Objections to the report affect the weight given it, not its admissibility.

(4) Payment or Acceptance of Money. The payment or the acceptance of money by a party before trial does not necessarily prevent or delay the proceedings.

(L) Judgment.

(1) Requirements. A judgment for the plaintiff must

(a) comply with MCL 600.5741;

(b) state when and under what conditions, if any, an order of eviction will issue;

(c) separately state possession and money awards; and

(d) advise the defendant of the right to appeal or file a postjudgment motion within 10 days.

If the judgment is in favor of the defendant, it must comply with MCL 600.5747.

(2) Injunctions. The judgment may award injunctive relief

(a) to prevent the person in possession from damaging the property; or

(b) to prevent the person seeking possession from rendering the premises untenantable, or from suffering the premises to remain untenantable.

(3) Partial Payment. The judgment may provide that acceptance of partial payment of an amount due under the judgment will not prevent issuance of an order of eviction.

(4) Costs. Only those costs permitted by MCL 600.5759 may be awarded.

(5) Notice. The court must mail or deliver a copy of the judgment to the parties. The time period for applying for the order of eviction does not begin to run until the judgment is mailed or delivered.

(M) Order of Eviction.

(1) Request. When the time stated in the judgment expires, a party awarded possession may apply for an order of eviction. The application must:

(a) be written;

(b) be verified by a person having knowledge of the facts stated;

(c) if any money has been paid after entry of the judgment, show the conditions under which it was accepted; and

(d) state whether the party awarded judgment has complied with its terms.

(2) Issuance of Order of Eviction and Delivery of Order. Subject to the provisions of subrule (M)(4), the order of eviction shall be delivered to the person serving the order for service within 7 days after the order is filed.

(3) Issuance Immediately on Judgment. The court may issue an order immediately on entering judgment if

(a) the court is convinced the statutory requirements are satisfied, and

(b) the defendant was given notice, before the judgment of a request for immediate issuance of the order.

The court may condition the order to protect the defendant's interest.

(4) Limitations on Time for Issuance and Execution. Unless a hearing is held after the defendant has been given notice and an opportunity to appear, an order of eviction may not

(a) be issued later than 56 days after judgment is entered,

(b) be executed later than 56 days after it is issued.

(5) Acceptance of Partial Payment. An order of eviction may not be issued if any part of the amount due under the judgment has been paid, unless

(a) a hearing is held after the defendant has been given notice and an opportunity to appear, or

(b) the judgment provides that acceptance of partial payment of the amount due under the judgment will not prevent issuance of an order of eviction.

(N) Postjudgment Motions. Except as provided in MCR 2.612, any postjudgment motion must be filed no later than 10 days after judgment enters.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subrule, if the motion challenges a judgment for possession, the court may not grant a stay. The court shall grant a stay if

(a) the motion is accompanied by an escrow deposit of 1 month's rent, or

(b) the court is satisfied that there are grounds for relief under MCR 2.612(C), and issues an order that waives payment of the escrow; such an order may be ex parte.

If a stay is granted, a hearing shall be held within 14 days after it is issued.

(2) If the judgment does not include an award of possession, the filing of the motion stays proceedings, but the plaintiff may move for an order requiring a bond to secure the stay. If the initial escrow deposit is believed inadequate, the plaintiff may apply for continuing adequate escrow payments in accord with subrule (I)(2). The filing of a postjudgment motion together with a bond, bond order, or escrow deposit stays all proceedings, including an order of eviction issued but not executed.

(3) If a motion is filed to set aside a default money judgment, except when grounded on lack of jurisdiction over the defendant, the court may not grant the motion unless

(a) the motion is accompanied by an affidavit of facts showing a meritorious defense, and

(b) good cause is shown.

(O) Appeals From Possessory Judgments.

(1) Rules Applicable. Except as provided by this rule, appeals must comply with MCR 7.101 through 7.115.

(2) Time. An appeal of right must be filed within 10 days after the entry of judgment.

(3) Stay of Order of Eviction.

(a) Unless a stay is ordered by the trial court, an order of eviction must issue as provided in subrule (M).

(b) The filing of a claim of appeal together with a bond or escrow order of the court stays all proceedings, including an order of eviction issued but not executed.

(4) Appeal Bond; Escrow.

(a) A plaintiff who appeals must file a bond providing that if the plaintiff loses he or she will pay the appeal costs.

(b) A defendant who appeals must file a bond providing that if the defendant loses, he or she will pay

(i) the appeal costs,

(ii) the amount due stated in the judgment, and

(iii) damages from the time of forcible entry, the detainer, the notice to quit, or the demand for possession.

The court may waive the bond requirement of subrule (O)(4)(b)(i) on the grounds stated in MCR 2.002(C) or (D).

(c) If the plaintiff won a possession judgment, the court shall enter an escrow order under subrule (I)(2) and require the defendant to make payments while the appeal is pending. This escrow order may not be retroactive as to arrearages preceding the date of the posttrial escrow order unless there was a pretrial escrow order entered under subrule (H)(2), in which case the total escrow amount may include the amount accrued between the time of the original escrow order and the filing of the appeal.

(d) If it is established that an appellant cannot obtain sureties or make a sufficient cash deposit, the court must permit the appellant to comply with an escrow order.

(P) Objections to Fees Covered by Statute for Orders of Eviction. Objections shall be by motion. The fee to be paid shall be reasonable in light of all the circumstances. In determining the reasonableness of a fee, the court shall consider all issues bearing on reasonableness, including but not limited to

(1) the time of travel to the premises,

(2) the time necessary to execute the order,

(3) the amount and weight of the personal property removed from the premises,

(4) who removed the personal property from the premises,

(5) the distance that the personal property was moved from the premises, and

(6) the actual expenses incurred in executing the order of eviction.

(1) A party may join a claim or counterclaim for equitable relief or a money claim or counterclaim described by MCL 600.5739. A money claim must be separately stated in the complaint. A money counterclaim must be labeled and separately stated in a written answer. If such a joinder is made, the court may order separate summary disposition of the claim for possession, as described by MCL 600.5739.

(2) A court with a territorial jurisdiction which has a population of more than 1,000,000 may provide, by local rule, that a money claim or counterclaim must be tried separately from a claim for possession unless joinder is allowed by leave of the court pursuant to subrule (I)(3).

(3) If adjudication of a money counterclaim will affect the amount the defendant must pay to prevent the issuance of a writ of restitution, the counterclaim must be tried at the same time as the claim for possession, subrules (I)(1) and (2) notwithstanding, unless it appears to the court that the counterclaim is without merit.

(4) If a money claim or counterclaim exceeding the court's jurisdiction is introduced, the court, on motion of either party or on its own initiative, shall order, in accordance with the procedures in MCR 4.002, removal of that portion of the action, if the money claim or counterclaim is sufficiently shown to exceed the court's jurisdictional limit.
