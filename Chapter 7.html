(2) Amendment. The Court of Appeals may, upon motion and good cause shown, allow for the amendment of the docketing statement.

(3) Cross-Appeals. A party who files a cross-appeal must file a docketing statement in accordance with this rule within 28 days after filing the cross-appeal.

(4) Dismissal. Failure to file a timely docketing statement may result in dismissal of the appeal or cross-appeal under MCR 7.217.

Rule 7.205 Application for Leave to Appeal
(A) Time Requirements. The time limit for an application for leave to appeal is jurisdictional. See MCR 7.203(B). The provisions of MCR 1.108 regarding computation of time apply. For purposes of this subrule, “entry” means the date a judgment or order is signed, or the date that data entry of the judgment or order is accomplished in the issuing tribunal’s register of actions.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an application for leave to appeal must be filed within:

(a) 21 days after entry of the judgment or order to be appealed from or within other time as allowed by law or rule; or

(b) 21 days after entry of an order deciding a motion for new trial, a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, or a motion for other relief from the order or judgment appealed, if the motion was filed within the initial 21-day appeal period or within further time the trial court has allowed for good cause during that 21-day period.

(2) In a criminal case involving a final judgment or final order entered in that case, an application for leave to appeal filed on behalf of the defendant must be filed within the later of:

(a) 6 months after entry of the judgment or order; or

(b) 42 days after:

(i) an order appointing appellate counsel or substitute counsel, or denying a request for appellate counsel, if the defendant requested counsel within 6 months after entry of the judgment or order to be appealed;

(ii) the filing of transcripts ordered under MCR 6.425(G)(1)(f), if the defendant requested counsel within 6 months after entry of the judgment or order to be appealed;

(iii) the filing of transcripts ordered under MCR 6.433, if the defendant requested the transcripts within 6 months after entry of the judgment or order to be appealed;

(iv) an order deciding a timely filed motion to withdraw plea under MCR 6.310(C), motion for directed verdict under MCR 6.419(C), motion to correct an invalid sentence under MCR 6.429(B), or motion for new trial under MCR 6.431(A); or

(v) an order deciding a timely filed motion for reconsideration of an order described in subrule (A)(2)(b)(iv).

A defendant relying on subrule (A)(2)(b) must provide a statement, supported by relevant documentation, explaining how the application meets the requirements of the subrule.

(3) In an appeal from an order terminating parental rights, an application for leave to appeal must be filed within 63 days, as provided by MCR 3.993(C)(2).

(4) Delayed Application for Leave to Appeal.

(a) For appeals governed by subrule (A)(1), when an application is not filed within the time provided by that subrule, a delayed application for leave to appeal may be filed within 6 months of the entry of a judgment or order described in that subrule.

(b) For appeals governed by subrule (A)(1) or (2), if the Court of Appeals dismisses a claim of appeal for lack of jurisdiction, a delayed application for leave to appeal may also be filed within 21 days of the entry of the dismissal order or an order denying reconsideration of that order, provided that:

(i) the delayed application is taken from the same lower court judgment or order as the claim of appeal, and

(ii) the claim of appeal was filed within the applicable time period in subrule (A)(1) or (2).

A delayed application under this rule must contain a statement of facts explaining the reasons for delay. The appellee may challenge the claimed reasons in the answer. The court may consider the length of and the reasons for delay in deciding whether to grant the delayed application.

(5) In a criminal case, except as provided in subrule (4)(b), the defendant may not file an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence if the defendant has previously taken an appeal from that judgment by right or leave granted or has sought leave to appeal that was denied.

(B) Manner of Filing. To apply for leave to appeal, the appellant must file with the clerk:

(1) an application for leave to appeal stating the date and nature of the judgment or order appealed from; concisely reciting the appellant’s allegations of error and the relief sought; setting forth a concise argument, conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C), in support of the appellant’s position on each issue; and, if the order appealed from is interlocutory, setting forth facts showing how the appellant would suffer substantial harm by awaiting final judgment before taking an appeal;

(d) in an appeal from a judgment in a criminal case entered pursuant to a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the transcripts of the plea and sentence;

(e) in an appeal from an order granting or denying a new trial, such portion of the transcript of the trial as, in relation to the issues raised, permits the court to determine whether the trial court’s decision on the motion was for a legally recognized reason and based on arguable support in the record;

(f) in an appeal raising a sentencing issue, the transcript of the sentencing proceeding and the transcript of any hearing on a motion relating to sentencing;

(2) The court may grant or deny the application, enter a final decision, grant other relief, or request additional material from the record.

(3) If an application is granted, the case proceeds as an appeal of right, except that the filing of a claim of appeal is not required and the time limits for the filing of a cross-appeal and for the taking of the other steps in the appeal, including the filing of the docketing statement (28 days), and the filing of the court reporter’s or recorder’s certificate if the transcript has not been filed (14 days), run from the date the order granting leave is certified.

(4) Unless otherwise ordered, the appeal is limited to the issues raised in the application and supporting brief.

(F) Expedited Decision. When a party requires a decision on an application by a date certain, the party may file a motion for immediate consideration of the application as provided in MCR 7.211(C)(6).

In all other respects, submission, decision, and further proceedings are as provided in subrule (E).

Rule 7.206 Extraordinary Writs, Original Actions, and Enforcement Actions
(A) General Rules of Pleading. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the general rules of pleading apply as nearly as practicable. See MCR 1.109 and 2.111-2.113.

(B) Superintending Control, Mandamus, and Habeas Corpus. To the extent that they do not conflict with this rule, the rules in subchapter 3.300 apply to actions for superintending control, mandamus, and habeas corpus.

(C) Quo Warranto. In a quo warranto action, the Attorney General also must be served with a copy of each pleading and document filed in the Court of Appeals. The Attorney General has the right to intervene as a party on either side.

(D) Actions for Extraordinary Writs and Original Actions.

(1) Filing of Complaint. To commence an original action, the plaintiff must file with the clerk:

(a) a complaint, which may have supporting documents or affidavits attached;

(b) a supporting brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) to the extent possible;

(c) proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on every defendant and, in a superintending control action, on any other party involved in the case that gave rise to the complaint for superintending control; and

(a) an answer to the complaint, which may have supporting documents or affidavits attached;

(b) a supporting brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (D) to the extent possible; and

(c) proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on the plaintiff and any other interested party.

(3) Preliminary Hearing. There is no oral argument on preliminary hearing of a complaint. The court may deny relief, grant peremptory relief, or allow the parties to proceed to full hearing on the merits in the same manner as an appeal of right either with or without referral to a judicial circuit or tribunal or agency for the taking of proofs and report of factual findings. If the case is ordered to proceed to full hearing, the time for filing a brief by the plaintiff begins to run from the date the order allowing the case to proceed is certified or the date the transcript or report of factual findings on referral is filed, whichever is later. The plaintiff’s brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (C). An opposing brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (D). In a habeas corpus proceeding, the prisoner need not be brought before the Court of Appeals.

(E) Actions to Enforce the Headlee Amendment, Under Const 1963, art 9, § 32.

(1)   Filing of Complaint. To commence an action under Const 1963, art 9, § 32, the plaintiff must file with the clerk:

(a)    a complaint, which conforms with the special pleading requirements of MCR 2.112(M) and indicates whether there are any factual questions that are anticipated to require resolution by the court and whether the plaintiff anticipates the need for discovery and the development of a factual record;

(b)    a supporting brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) to the extent possible;

(c)    proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on every defendant and the office of the attorney general; and

(d)    the entry fee.

(2)    Answer. A defendant must file with the clerk within 21 days of service of the complaint:

(a)    an answer to the complaint, which conforms with the special pleading requirements of MCR 2.112(M) and indicates whether there are any factual questions that are anticipated to require resolution by the court and whether a defendant anticipates the need for discovery and the development of a factual record;

(b)    a supporting brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) to the extent possible;

(c)    proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on every plaintiff.

(3)    Subsequent proceedings. Following receipt of the answer:

(a)    the clerk must promptly select a panel of the court by random draw and assign that panel to commence proceedings in the suit; and

(b) the panel of the court may deny relief or grant peremptory relief without oral argument; or

(c)    if the panel of the court determines that the issues framed in the parties’ pleadings and supporting briefs solely present jurisprudentially significant questions of law, the panel must direct that the suit proceed to a full hearing on the merits in the same manner as an appeal of right and notify the parties of the date for the filing of supplemental briefs, if such briefs are determined to be necessary, and of the date for oral argument, which must be on an expedited basis; or

(d)    if the panel of the court determines that the issues framed in the parties’ pleadings and supplemental briefs present factual questions for resolution, the panel must refer the suit to a judicial circuit for the purposes of holding pretrial proceedings, conducting a hearing to receive evidence and arguments of law, and issuing a written report for the panel setting forth proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The proceedings before the circuit court must proceed as expeditiously as due consideration of the circuit court’s docket, facts and issues of law requires. Following the receipt of the report from the circuit court, the panel must notify counsel for the parties of the schedule for filing briefs in response to the circuit court’s report and of the date for oral argument, which must be on an expedited basis.

(F) Enforcement of Administrative Tribunal or Agency Orders.

(1) Complaint. To obtain enforcement of a final order of an administrative tribunal or agency, the plaintiff must file with the clerk within the time limit provided by law:

(a) a complaint concisely stating the basis for relief and the relief sought;

(b) the order sought to be enforced;

(c) a supporting brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) to the extent possible;

(d) proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on the defendant, the agency (unless the agency is the plaintiff), and any other interested party;

(e) the certified tribunal or agency record or evidence the plaintiff has requested that the certified record be sent to the Court of Appeals; and

(c) proof that a copy of each of the filed documents was served on the plaintiff, the agency, and any other interested party.

(3) Preliminary Hearing. There is no oral argument on preliminary hearing of a complaint. The court may deny relief, grant peremptory relief, or allow the parties to proceed to full hearing on the merits in the same manner as an appeal of right. If the case is ordered to proceed to full hearing, the time for filing of a brief by the plaintiff begins to run from the date the clerk certifies the order allowing the case to proceed. The plaintiff’s brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (C). An opposing brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (D). The case is heard on the certified record transmitted by the tribunal or agency. MCR 7.210(A)(2), regarding the content of the record, applies.

Rule 7.207 Cross-Appeals
(A) Right of Cross-Appeal.

(1) When an appeal of right is filed or the court grants leave to appeal any appellee may file a cross-appeal.

(2) If there is more than one party plaintiff or defendant in a civil action and one party appeals, any other party, whether on the same or opposite side as the party first appealing, may file a cross-appeal against all or any of the other parties to the case as well as against the party who first appealed. If the cross-appeal operates against a party not affected by the first appeal or in a manner different from the first appeal, that party may file a further cross-appeal as if the cross-appeal affecting that party had been the first appeal.

(B) Manner of Filing. To file a cross-appeal, the cross-appellant must file with the clerk a claim of cross-appeal in the form required by MCR 7.204(D) and the entry fee

(1) within 21 days after the claim of appeal is filed with the Court of Appeals or served on the cross-appellant, whichever is later, if the first appeal was of right; or

(2) within 21 days after the clerk certifies the order granting leave to appeal, if the appeal was initiated by application for leave to appeal.

The cross-appellant must file proof that a copy of the claim of cross-appeal was served on the cross-appellee and any other party in the case. A copy of the judgment or order from which the cross-appeal is taken must be filed with the claim.

(C) Additional Requirements. The cross-appellant must perform the steps required by MCR 7.204(E) and (F), except that the cross-appellant is not required to order a transcript or file a court reporter’s or recorder’s certificate unless the initial appeal is abandoned or dismissed. Otherwise the cross-appeal proceeds in the same manner as an ordinary appeal.

(D) Abandonment or Dismissal of Appeal. If the appellant abandons the initial appeal or the court dismisses it, the cross-appeal may nevertheless be prosecuted to its conclusion. Within 21 days after the clerk certifies the order dismissing the initial appeal, if there is a record to be transcribed, the cross-appellant must file a certificate of the court reporter or recorder that a transcript has been ordered and payment for it made or secured and will be filed as soon as possible or has already been filed.

(E) Delayed Cross-Appeal. A party seeking leave to take a delayed cross-appeal must proceed under MCR 7.205.

Rule 7.208 Authority of Court or Tribunal Appealed From
(A) Limitations. After a claim of appeal is filed or leave to appeal is granted, the trial court or tribunal may not set aside or amend the judgment or order appealed from except

(1) by order of the Court of Appeals,

(2) by stipulation of the parties,

(3) after a decision on the merits in an action in which a preliminary injunction was granted, or

(4) as otherwise provided by law.

In a criminal case, the filing of the claim of appeal does not preclude the trial court from granting a timely motion under subrule (B).

(B) Postjudgment Motions in Criminal Cases.

(1) Within the time for filing the defendant-appellant’s brief as provided by MCR 7.212(A)(1)(a)(iii), the defendant may file in the trial court a motion for a new trial, for judgment of acquittal, to withdraw a plea, or to correct an invalid sentence.

(2) A copy of the motion must be filed with the Court of Appeals and served on the prosecuting attorney.

(3) The trial court must hear and decide the motion within 56 days of filing, unless the court determines that an adjournment is necessary to secure evidence needed for the decision on the motion or that there is other good cause for an adjournment.

(4) Within 28 days of the trial court’s decision, the court reporter or recorder must file with the trial court clerk the transcript of any hearing held.

(5) If the motion is granted in whole or in part,

(a) the defendant must file the appellant’s brief or a notice of withdrawal of the appeal within 42 days after the trial court’s decision or after the filing of the transcript of any hearing held, whichever is later;

(b) the prosecuting attorney may file a cross-appeal in the manner provided by MCR 7.207 within 21 days after the trial court’s decision. If the defendant has withdrawn the appeal before the prosecuting attorney has filed a cross-appeal, the prosecuting attorney may file a claim of appeal or an application for leave to appeal within the 21-day period.

(6) If the motion is denied, defendant-appellant’s brief must be filed within 42 days after the decision by the trial court or the filing of the transcript of any trial court hearing, whichever is later.

(C) Correction of Defects. Except as otherwise provided by rule and until the record is filed in the Court of Appeals, the trial court or tribunal has jurisdiction

(1) to grant further time to do, properly perform, or correct any act in the trial court or tribunal in connection with the appeal that was omitted or insufficiently done, other than to extend the time for filing a claim of appeal or for paying the entry fee or to allow delayed appeal;

(2) to correct any part of the record to be transmitted to the Court of Appeals, but only after notice to the parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the proposed correction.

After the record is filed in the Court of Appeals, the trial court may correct the record only with leave of the Court of Appeals.

(D) Probate Actions. The probate court retains continuing jurisdiction to decide other matters pertaining to the proceeding from which an appeal was filed.

(E) Supervision of Property. When an appeal is filed while property is being held for conservation or management under the order or judgment of the trial court, that court retains jurisdiction over the property pending the outcome of the appeal, except as the Court of Appeals otherwise orders.

(F) Temporary Orders. A trial court order entered before final judgment concerning custody, control, and management of property; temporary alimony, support or custody of a minor child, or expenses in a domestic relations action; or a preliminary injunction, remains in effect and is enforceable in the trial court, pending interlocutory appeal, except as the trial court or the Court of Appeals may otherwise order.

(G) Stays and Bonds. The trial court retains authority over stay and bond matters, except as the Court of Appeals otherwise orders.

(H) Matters Pertaining to Appointment of Attorney. Throughout the pendency of an appeal involving an indigent person, the trial court retains authority to appoint, remove, or replace an attorney except as the Court of Appeals otherwise orders.

(I) Acts by Other Judges. Whenever the trial judge who has heard a case dies, resigns, or vacates office, or is unable to perform any act necessary to an appeal of a case within the time prescribed by law or these rules, another judge of the same court, or if another judge of that court is unavailable, another judge assigned by the state court administrator, may perform the acts necessary to the review process. Whenever a case is heard by a judge assigned from another court, the judicial acts necessary in the preparation of a record for appeal may be performed, with consent of the parties, by a judge of the court in which the case was heard.

(J) Attorney Fees and Costs. The trial court may rule on requests for costs or attorney fees under court rule or other law, unless the Court of Appeals orders otherwise.

Rule 7.209 Bond; Stay of Proceedings
(A) Effect of Appeal; Prerequisites.

(1) Except for an automatic stay pursuant to MCR 2.614 or MCL 600.867, or except as otherwise provided under this rule, an appeal does not stay the effect or enforceability of a judgment or order of a trial court unless the trial court or the Court of Appeals otherwise orders. An automatic stay under MCR 2.614(D) operates to stay any and all proceedings in a cause in which a party has appealed a trial court’s denial of the party’s claim of governmental immunity.

(2) A motion for bond or for a stay pending appeal may not be filed in the Court of Appeals unless such a motion was decided by the trial court.

(3) A motion for bond or a stay pending appeal filed in the Court of Appeals must include a copy of the trial court’s opinion and order, and a copy of the transcript of the hearing on the motion in the trial court.

(B) Responsibility for Setting Amount of Bond in Trial Court.

(1) Civil Actions and Probate Proceedings. Unless determined by law, or as otherwise provided by this rule, the dollar amount of a stay or appeal bond in a civil action or probate proceeding must be set by the trial court in an amount adequate to protect the opposite party.

(2) Criminal Cases. In a criminal case the granting of bond pending appeal and the amount of it are within the discretion of the trial court, subject to applicable law and rules. Bond must be sufficient to guarantee the appearance of the defendant. Unless bond pending appeal is allowed and a bond is filed with the trial court, a criminal judgment may be executed immediately, even though the time for taking an appeal has not elapsed.

(C) Amendment of Bond. On motion, the trial court may order an additional or different bond, set the amount, and approve or require different sureties.

(D) Review by Court of Appeals. Except as otherwise provided by rule or law, on motion filed in a case pending before it, the Court of Appeals may amend the amount of bond set by the trial court, order an additional or different bond and set the amount, or require different or additional sureties. The Court of Appeals may also refer a bond or bail matter to the court from which the appeal is taken. The Court of Appeals may grant a stay of proceedings in the trial court or stay of effect or enforcement of any judgment or order of a trial court on the terms it deems just.

(E) Stay of Proceedings by Trial Court.

(1) Unless otherwise provided by rule, statute, or court order, an execution may not issue and proceedings may not be taken to enforce an order or judgment until expiration of the time for taking an appeal of right.

(2) An appeal does not stay execution unless:

(a) Except in a domestic relations matter, the party seeking to stay a money judgment files with the court a bond in compliance with MCR 3.604 in an amount not less than 110% of the judgment or order being enforced, including any costs, interest, attorney fees, and sanctions assessed to the date of filing the bond, with the party in whose favor the judgment or order was entered as the obligee, by which the party promises to

(i) perform and satisfy the judgment or order stayed if it is not set aside or reversed, and

(ii) prosecute to completion any appeal subsequently taken from the judgment or order stayed and perform and satisfy the judgment or order entered by the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court; or

(b) The trial court grants a stay with or without bond, or with a reduced bond, as justice requires or as otherwise provided by statute (see MCL 500.3036).

(3) The court may order, on stipulation or otherwise, other forms of security in lieu of the bond in subsection (E)(2)(a), including but not limited to an irrevocable letter of credit.

(4) When the bond is filed under subsection (E)(2)(a), the judgment or order is automatically stayed pending entry of a final order under subsection (G).

(5) If a stay bond filed under this subrule substantially meets the requirements of subrule (F), it will be a sufficient bond to stay proceedings pending disposition of an appeal subsequently filed.

(6) The stay order must conform to any condition expressly required by the statute authorizing review.

(7) If a government party files a claim of appeal from an order described in MCR 7.202(6)(a)(v), the proceedings are stayed during the pendency of the appeal, unless the Court of Appeals directs otherwise.

(F) Conditions of Stay Bond.

(1) Civil Actions and Probate Proceedings. In a bond filed for stay pending appeal in a civil action or probate proceeding, the appellant must promise in writing:

(a) to prosecute the appeal to decision;

(b) to perform or satisfy a judgment or order of the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court;

(c) to perform or satisfy the judgment or order appealed from, if the appeal is dismissed;

(d) in an action involving the possession of land or judgment for foreclosure of a mortgage or land contract, to pay the appellee the damages which may result from the stay of proceedings; and

(e) to do any other act which is expressly required in the statute authorizing appeal.

(2) Criminal Cases. A criminal defendant for whom bond pending appeal is allowed after conviction must promise in writing:

(a) to prosecute the appeal to decision;

(b) if the sentence is one of incarceration, to surrender himself or herself to the sheriff of the county in which he or she was convicted or other custodial authority if the sentence is affirmed on appeal or if the appeal is dismissed;

(c) if the judgment or order appealed is other than a sentence of incarceration, to perform and comply with the order of the trial court if it is affirmed on appeal or if the appeal is dismissed;

(d) to appear in the trial court if the case is remanded for retrial or further proceedings or if a conviction is reversed and retrial is allowed;

(e) to remain in Michigan unless the court gives written approval to leave; and

(f) to notify the trial court clerk of a change of address.

(G) Sureties and Filing of Bond; Service of Bond; Objections; Stay Orders. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this rule, MCR 3.604 applies. A bond must be filed with the clerk of the court that entered the order or judgment to be stayed.

(1) Civil Actions and Probate Proceedings.

(a)    A copy of a bond and any accompanying power of attorney or affidavit must be promptly served on all parties in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107. At the same time, the party seeking the stay must file a proposed stay order under MCR 2.602(B)(3). Proof of service must be filed promptly with the trial court in which the bond has been filed.

(b)    Objections must be filed and served within seven days after service of the bond. Objections to the amount of the bond are governed by MCR 2.602(B)(3). Objections to the surety are governed by MCR 3.604(E).

(c)    If no timely objections to the bond, surety, or stay order are filed, the trial court must promptly enter the order staying enforcement of the judgment or order pending all appeals. The stay continues until otherwise ordered by the trial court or an appellate court.

(d)    Any stay order must be promptly served on all parties in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107. Proof of service must be filed promptly with the trial court.

(e)    All hearings under this rule may be held by telephone conference as provided in MCR 2.402.

(f)    For good cause shown, the trial court may set the amount of the bond in a greater or lesser amount adequate to protect the interests of the parties.

(g)    A bond may be secured under MCL 600.2631.

(2) Criminal Cases. A criminal defendant filing a bond after conviction must give notice to the county prosecuting attorney of the time and place the bond will be filed. The bond is subject to the objection procedure provided in MCR 3.604.

(H) Stay of Execution.

(1) If a bond is filed before execution issues, and notice is given to the officer having authority to issue execution, execution is stayed. If the bond is filed after the issuance but before execution, and notice is given to the officer holding it, execution is suspended.

(2) The Court of Appeals may stay or terminate a stay of any order or judgment of a lower court or tribunal on just terms.

(3) When the amount of the judgment is more than $1000 over the insurance policy coverage or surety obligation, then the policy or obligation does not qualify to stay execution under MCL 500.3036 on the portion of the judgment in excess of the policy or bond limits. Stay pending appeal may be achieved by complying with that statute and by filing a bond in an additional amount adequate to protect the opposite party or by obtaining a trial court or Court of Appeals order waiving the additional bond.

(4) A statute exempting a municipality or other governmental agency from filing a bond to stay execution supersedes the requirements of this rule.

(I) Ex Parte Stay. Whenever an ex parte stay of proceedings is necessary to allow a motion in either the trial court or the Court of Appeals, the court before which the motion will be heard may grant an ex parte stay for that purpose. Service of a copy of the order, with a copy of the motion, any affidavits on which the motion is based, and notice of hearing on the motion, operates as a stay of proceedings until the court rules on the motion unless the court supersedes or sets aside the order in the interim. Proceedings may not be stayed for longer than necessary to enable the party to make the motion according to the practice of the court and, if made, until the decision of the court.

Rule 7.210 Record on Appeal
(A) Content of Record. Appeals to the Court of Appeals are heard on the original record.

(1) Appeal From Court. In an appeal from a lower court, the record consists of the original documents filed in that court or a certified copy, the transcript of any testimony or other proceedings in the case appealed, and the exhibits introduced. In an appeal from probate court in an estate or trust proceeding, an adult or minor guardianship proceeding under the Estates and Protected Individuals Code, or a proceeding under the Mental Health Code, only the order appealed from and those petitions, opinions, and other documents pertaining to it need be included.

(2) Appeal From Tribunal or Agency. In an appeal from an administrative tribunal or agency, the record includes all documents, files, pleadings, testimony, and opinions and orders of the tribunal, agency, or officer (or a certified copy), except those summarized or omitted in whole or in part by stipulation of the parties. Testimony not transcribed when the certified record is sent for consideration of an application for leave to appeal, and not omitted by stipulation of the parties, must be filed and sent to the court as promptly as possible.

(3) Excluded Evidence. The substance or transcript of excluded evidence offered at a trial and the proceedings at the trial in relation to it must be included as part of the record on appeal.

(4) Stipulations. The parties in any appeal to the Court of Appeals may stipulate in writing regarding any matters relevant to the lower court or tribunal or agency record if the stipulation is made a part of the record on appeal and sent to the Court of Appeals.

(B) Transcript.

(1) Appellant’s Duties; Orders; Stipulations.

(a) The appellant is responsible for securing the filing of the transcript as provided in this rule. Except in cases governed by MCR 3.993(E) or MCR 6.425(G), or as otherwise provided by Court of Appeals order or the remainder of this subrule, the appellant must order from the court reporter or recorder the full transcript of testimony and other proceedings in the trial court or tribunal. Once an appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals, a party must serve a copy of any request for transcript preparation on opposing counsel and file a copy with the Court of Appeals.

(b) In an appeal from probate court in an estate or trust proceeding, an adult or minor guardianship proceeding under the Estates and Protected Individuals Code, or a proceeding under the Mental Health Code, only that portion of the transcript concerning the order appealed from need be filed. The appellee may file additional portions of the transcript.

(c) On the appellant’s motion, with notice to the appellee, the trial court or tribunal may order that some portion less than the full transcript (or no transcript at all) be included in the record on appeal. The motion must be filed within the time required for filing an appeal, and, if the motion is granted, the appellee may file any portions of the transcript omitted by the appellant. The filing of the motion extends the time for filing the court reporter’s or recorder’s certificate until seven days after entry of the trial court’s or tribunal’s order on the motion.

(d) The parties may stipulate that some portion less than the full transcript (or none) be filed.

(e) The parties may agree on a statement of facts without procuring the transcript and the statement signed by the parties may be filed with the trial court or tribunal clerk and sent as the record of testimony in the action.

(2) Transcript Unavailable. When a transcript of the proceedings in the trial court or tribunal cannot be obtained from the court reporter or recorder, the appellant must take the following steps to settle the record and to cause the filing of a certified settled statement of facts to serve as a substitute for the transcript.

(a) No later than 56 days after the filing of the available transcripts, or 28 days after the filing of the available transcripts in a child custody case or interlocutory criminal appeal, or, if no transcripts are available, within 14 days after filing the claim of appeal, the appellant must file with the trial court or tribunal clerk, and serve on each appellee, a motion to settle the record and, where reasonably possible, a proposed statement of facts. A proposed statement of facts must concisely set forth the substance of the testimony, or the oral proceedings before the trial court or tribunal if no testimony was taken, in sufficient detail to provide for appellate review.

(b) Except as otherwise provided, the appellant must notice the motion to settle the record for hearing before the trial court or tribunal to be held within 21 days of the filing of the motion. If it is not the typical practice of a tribunal to conduct hearings, the motion to settle the record must be filed with the tribunal for consideration by the tribunal within 21 days of the filing of the motion. The motion must be filed and served at least 14 days before the date noticed for hearing or consideration to settle the record. If appellant filed a proposed statement of facts with the motion, appellee must file and serve on the appellant and other appellees an amendment or objection to the proposed statement of facts in the trial court or tribunal at least seven days before the time set for the settlement hearing or consideration. The trial court may adopt and file the appellant’s proposed statement of facts as the certified settled statement of facts.

(c) The trial court or tribunal must settle any controversy and certify a settled statement of facts as an accurate, fair, and complete statement of the proceedings before it. The certified settled statement of facts must concisely set forth the substance of the testimony, or the oral proceedings before the trial court or tribunal if no testimony was taken, in sufficient detail to provide for appellate review.

(d) The appellant must file the settled statement of facts and the certifying order with the trial court or tribunal clerk and Court of Appeals.

(3) Duties of Court Reporter or Recorder.

(a) Certificate. Within seven days after a transcript is ordered by a party or the court, the court reporter or recorder must file a certificate stating:

(i) that the transcript has been ordered, that payment for the transcript has been made or secured, that it will be filed as soon as possible or has already been filed, and the estimated number of pages for each of the proceedings requested;

(ii) as to each proceeding requested, whether the court reporter or recorder filing the certificate recorded the proceeding; and if not,

(iii) the name and certification number of the court reporter or recorder responsible for the transcript of that proceeding.

(b) Time for Filing. The court reporter or recorder must give precedence to transcripts necessary for interlocutory criminal appeals and custody cases. The court reporter or recorder must file the transcript with the trial court or tribunal clerk within

(i) 14 days after it is ordered for an application for leave to appeal from an order granting or denying a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal case;

(ii) 28 days after it is ordered in an appeal of a criminal conviction based on a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere;

(iii) 42 days after it is ordered in any other interlocutory criminal appeal or custody case;

(iv) 91 days after it is ordered in other cases.

The Court of Appeals may extend or shorten these time limits in an appeal pending in the court on motion filed by the court reporter or recorder or a party.

(c) Copies. Additional copies of the transcripts required by the appellant may be ordered from the court reporter or recorder or photocopies may be made of the transcript furnished by the court reporter or recorder.

(d) Form of Transcript. The transcript must be filed in one or more volumes stating the title of the action, and prefaced by a table of contents showing the subject matter of the transcript with page references to the significant parts of the trial or proceedings, including the testimony of each witness by name, the arguments of the attorneys, and the jury instructions. The pages of the transcript must be consecutively numbered on the bottom of each page. Transcripts filed with the court must contain only a single transcript page per document page, not multiple pages combined on a single document page.

(e) Notice. Immediately after the transcript is filed, the court reporter or recorder must notify the Court of Appeals and all parties that it has been filed and file in the Court of Appeals an affidavit of mailing of notice to the parties.

(f) Discipline. A court reporter or recorder failing to comply with the requirements of these rules is subject to disciplinary action by the courts, including punishment for contempt of court, on the court’s own initiative or motion of a party.

(C) Exhibits. Within 21 days after the claim of appeal is filed, a party possessing any exhibits offered in evidence, whether admitted or not, must file them with the trial court or tribunal clerk, unless by stipulation of the parties or order of the trial court or tribunal they are not to be sent, or copies, summaries, or excerpts are to be sent. Copies of exhibits may be filed in lieu of originals unless the trial court or tribunal orders otherwise. When the record is returned to the trial court or tribunal, the trial court or tribunal clerk must return the exhibits to the parties who filed them.

(D) Reproduction of Records. Where facilities for the copying or reproduction of records are available to the clerk of the court or tribunal whose action is to be reviewed, the clerk, on a party’s request and on deposit of the estimated cost or security for the cost, must procure for the party as promptly as possible and at the cost to the clerk the requested number of copies of documents, transcripts, and exhibits on file.

(E) Record on Motion. If, before the time the complete record on appeal is sent to the Court of Appeals, a party files a motion that requires the Court of Appeals to have the record, the trial court or tribunal clerk must, on request of a party or the Court of Appeals, send the Court of Appeals the documents needed.

(F) Service of Record. Within 21 days after the transcript is filed with the trial court clerk, the appellant must serve a copy of the entire record on appeal, including the transcript and exhibits, on each appellee. However, copies of documents the appellee already possesses need not be served. Proof that the record was served must be promptly filed with the Court of Appeals and the trial court or tribunal clerk. If the filing of a transcript has been excused as provided in subrule (B), the record is to be served within 21 days after the filing of the transcript substitute.

(G) Transmission of Record. Within 21 days after the briefs have been filed or the time for filing the appellee’s brief has expired, or when the court requests, the trial court or tribunal clerk must send to the Court of Appeals the record on appeal in the case pending on appeal, except for those things omitted by written stipulation of the parties. Weapons, drugs, or money are not to be sent unless the Court of Appeals requests. The trial court or tribunal clerk must append a certificate identifying the name of the case and the documents with reasonable definiteness and must include as part of the record:

(1) a register of actions in the case;

(2) all opinions, findings, and orders of the court or tribunal; and

(3) the order or judgment appealed from.

Transcripts and all other documents that are part of the record on appeal must be included in the record and, if filed in print, must be attached in one or more file folders or other suitable hard-surfaced binders showing the name of the trial court or tribunal, the title of the case, and the file number.

(H) Return of Record Filed in Printed Form. If the record was filed in printed form, after the Court of Appeals disposes of the appeal, the clerk must promptly send it to

(1) the Clerk of the Supreme Court on request if an application for leave to appeal is filed in the Supreme Court, or

(2) the clerk of the court or tribunal from which it was received when

(a) the period for an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has expired without the filing of an application, and

(b) the period for filing a motion for reconsideration in the Court of Appeals has expired and any timely filed motion has been resolved, and

(c) the period for initiation of a special panel under MCR 7.215(J) has expired and any proceedings under that subrule are concluded.

(I) Disposition of Record Filed in Electronic Form. If the record is filed in electronic form, the Court of Appeals may dispose of the electronic record according to the standards established by the court.

(J) Notice by Trial Court or Tribunal Clerk. In order that the parties may take the appropriate action in the trial court or tribunal under the Court of Appeals judgment, the trial court or tribunal clerk must promptly notify all parties of the return of the record, if filed in printed form, or of the expiration of the time under subrule (H)(2) if the record was filed in electronic form.

Rule 7.211 Motions in Court of Appeals
(A) Manner of Making Motion. A motion is made in the Court of Appeals by filing:

(1) a motion stating briefly but distinctly the facts and the grounds on which it is based and the relief requested;

(2) the entry fee;

(3) for a motion to dismiss, to affirm, or for peremptory reversal, a supporting brief. A supporting brief may be filed with any other motion. A brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) as nearly as possible, except that page references to a transcript are not required unless the transcript is relevant to the issue raised in the motion. A brief is not required in support of a motion to affirm when the appellant argues that:

(a) the trial court’s findings of fact are clearly erroneous;

(b) the trial court erred in applying established law;

(c) the trial court abused its discretion; or

(d) a sentence that is within the sentencing guidelines is invalid.

Instead of a brief in support of a motion to affirm in such a circumstance, the movant may append those portions of the transcript that are pertinent to the issues raised in the motion; in that case, the motion must include a summary of the movant’s position;

(4) a motion for immediate consideration under subrule (C)(6) if the party wants a decision on the motion on a date earlier than the answer date set forth in subrules (B)(2)(a)-(e);

(5) proof that the motion, the motion for immediate consideration if one has been filed, and any supporting documents were served on all other parties to the appeal.

(B) Answer.

(1) A party to an appeal may answer a motion by filing:

(a) an answer and

(b) proof that the answer and any supporting documents were served on all other parties to the appeal.

(2) Subject to subrule (3), the answer must be filed within

(a) 21 days after the motion is served on the other parties for a motion to dismiss, to remand, or to affirm;

(b) 35 days after the motion is served on the appellee if the motion is for peremptory reversal;

(c) 56 days after the motion is served on the defendant for a motion to withdraw as the appointed appellate attorney;

(d) 14 days after the motion is served on the other parties for a motion for reconsideration of an opinion or an order, to stay proceedings in the trial court, to strike a full or partial pleading on appeal, to file an amicus brief, to hold an appeal in abeyance, or to reinstate an appeal after dismissal under MCR 7.217(D);

(e) seven days after the motion is served on the other parties for all other motions.

If a motion for immediate consideration has been filed, answers to all affected motions must be filed within seven days or within such time as the Court of Appeals directs. See subrule (C)(6).

(3) In its discretion, the Court of Appeals may dispose of the following motions before the answer period has expired: a motion to extend time to order or file transcripts, to extend time to file a brief or other appellate pleading, to substitute one attorney for another, for oral argument when the right to oral argument was not otherwise preserved as described in MCR 7.212, or for an out-of-state attorney to appear and practice in Michigan.

(4) A supporting brief may be filed with the answer. A brief must conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (D) as nearly as possible, except that page references to a transcript are not required unless the transcript is relevant to the issue raised in the motion.

(C) Special Motions.

(1) Motion to Remand.

(a) The appellant may move to remand to the trial court. The motion must identify an issue sought to be reviewed on appeal and show

(i) that the issue is one that is of record and that must be initially decided by the trial court; or

(ii) that development of a factual record is required for appellate consideration of the issue.

A motion under this subrule must be supported by affidavit or offer of proof regarding the facts to be established at a hearing.

(b) A timely motion must be granted if it is accompanied by a certificate from the trial court that it will grant a motion for new trial.

(c) In a case tried without a jury, the appellant need not file a motion for remand or a motion for new trial to challenge the great weight of the evidence in order to preserve the issue for appeal.

(d) If a motion to remand is filed, further proceedings in the Court of Appeals are stayed until the motion is denied or the trial court proceedings are completed, unless the Court of Appeals orders otherwise.

(e) If the trial court grants the appellant relief in whole or in part,

(i) unless the Court of Appeals orders otherwise, appellant must file the brief on appeal or notice of withdrawal of appeal within 21 days after the trial court's decision or after the filing of the transcript of any hearing held, whichever is later.

(ii) the appellee may file a cross-appeal in the manner provided by MCR 7.207 within 21 days after the trial court's decision. If the appellant has withdrawn the appeal before the appellee has filed a cross-appeal, the appellee may file a claim of appeal or an application for leave to appeal within the 21-day period.

(f) If the trial court denies the appellant's request for relief, appellant's brief must be filed within 21 days after the decision by the trial court or the filing of the transcript of any trial court hearing, whichever is later.

(2) Motion to Dismiss. An appellee may file a motion to dismiss an appeal any time before it is placed on a session calendar on the ground that

(a) the appeal is not within the Court of Appeals jurisdiction;

(b) the appeal was not filed or pursued in conformity with the rules; or

(c) the appeal is moot.

(3) Motion to Affirm. After the appellant’s brief has been filed, an appellee may file a motion to affirm the order or judgment appealed from on the ground that

(a) it is manifest that the questions sought to be reviewed are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission; or

(b) the questions sought to be reviewed were not timely or properly raised.

The decision to grant a motion to affirm must be unanimous. An order denying a motion to affirm may identify the judge or judges who would have granted it but for the unanimity requirement of this subrule.

(4) Motion for Peremptory Reversal. The appellant may file a motion for peremptory reversal on the ground that reversible error is so manifest that an immediate reversal of the judgment or order appealed from should be granted without formal argument or submission. The decision to grant a motion for peremptory reversal must be unanimous. An order denying a motion for peremptory reversal may identify the judge or judges who would have granted it but for the unanimity requirement of this subrule.

(5) Motion to Withdraw. A court-appointed appellate attorney for an indigent appellant may file a motion to withdraw if the attorney determines, after a conscientious and thorough review of the trial court record, that the appeal is wholly frivolous.

(a) A motion to withdraw is made by filing:

(i) a motion to withdraw that identifies any points the appellant seeks to assert and any other matters that the attorney has considered as a basis for appeal;

(ii) a brief conforming to MCR 7.212(B) and (C) that refers to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal, contains relevant record references, and discusses those authorities that appear to bear on the points in question;

(iii) proof that copies of the motion, brief in support, and notice that the motion may result in the conviction or trial court judgment being affirmed were served on the appellant by certified mail; and

(iv) proof that a copy of the motion only and not the brief was served on the appellee.

(b) If the appeal is available only by leave of the court, the motion must be filed within 56 days after the transcript is filed or within the deadline for filing a late application for leave to appeal, whichever comes first. The filing of such a motion, with the accompanying brief required by MCR 7.211(C)(5)(a)(ii), must be treated as the filing of an application for leave to appeal on behalf of the appellant.

(c) The motion to withdraw and supporting papers will be submitted to the court for decision on the first Tuesday

(i) 28 days after the appellant is served in appeals from orders of the family division of the circuit court terminating parental rights under the Juvenile Code, or

(ii) 56 days after the appellant is served in all other appeals.

The appellant may file with the court an answer and brief in which he or she may make any comments and raise any points that he or she chooses concerning the appeal and the attorney’s motion. The appellant must file proof that a copy of the answer was served on his or her attorney.

(d) If the court finds that the appeal is wholly frivolous, it may grant the motion and affirm the conviction or trial court judgment in appeals by right or deny leave to appeal in appeals by leave. If the court affirms the conviction or trial court judgment or denies leave to appeal, the appellant’s attorney must mail to the appellant a copy of the transcript within 14 days after the order affirming is certified and file proof of that service. If the court finds any legal point arguable on its merits, it may deny the motion and order the court appointed attorney to proceed in support of the appeal or grant the motion and order the appointment of substitute appellate counsel to proceed in support of the appeal.

(6) Motion for Immediate Consideration. A party may file a motion for immediate consideration to expedite decision on another motion. The motion must state facts showing why immediate consideration is required. If the motion for immediate consideration and the motion of which immediate consideration is sought are served by electronic service under MCR 1.109(G)(6) or personally served under MCR 2.107(C)(1) or (2), the motions may be submitted to the court immediately on filing. If mail service is used, motions may not be submitted until the first Tuesday seven days after the date of service, unless the party served acknowledges receipt.

(7) Confession of Error by Prosecutor. In a criminal case, if the prosecutor concurs in the relief requested by the defendant, the prosecutor must file a confession of error and state reasons why concurrence in the relief requested is appropriate. The confession of error will be submitted to the court under MCR 7.211(E)(1). If the court approves the confession of error, the court will enter an order or opinion granting the relief and state the reason(s) for the approval. If the court rejects the confession of error, the court must state the reason(s) for the rejection, and the case will be submitted for decision through the ordinary processes of the court, and the confession of error will be submitted to the panel assigned to decide the case.

(8) Vexatious Proceedings. A party’s request for damages or other disciplinary action under MCR 7.216(C) must be contained in a motion filed under this rule. A request that is contained in any other pleading, including a brief filed under MCR 7.212, will not constitute a motion under this rule. A party may file a motion for damages or other disciplinary action under MCR 7.216(C) at any time within 21 days after the date of the order or opinion that disposes of the matter that is asserted to have been vexatious.

(9) Motion to Seal Court of Appeals File in Whole or in Part.

(a) Trial court files that have been sealed in whole or in part by a trial court order will remain sealed while in the possession of the Court of Appeals. Public requests to view such trial court files will be referred to the trial court.

(b) Materials that are subject to a protective order entered under MCR 2.302(C) may be submitted for inclusion in the Court of Appeals file in sealed form if they are accompanied by a copy of the protective order. A party objecting to such sealed submissions may file an appropriate motion in the Court of Appeals.

(c) Except as otherwise provided by statute or court rule, the procedure for sealing a Court of Appeals file is governed by MCR 8.119(I). Materials that are subject to a motion to seal a Court of Appeals file in whole or in part must be held under seal pending the court’s disposition of the motion.

(d) Any party or interested person may file an answer in response to a motion to seal a Court of Appeals file within seven days after the motion is served on the other parties, or within seven days after the motion is filed in the Court of Appeals, whichever is later.

(e) An order granting a motion must include a finding of good cause, as defined by MCR 8.119(I)(2), and a finding that there is no less-restrictive means to adequately and effectively protect the specific interest asserted.

(f) An order granting or denying a motion to seal a Court of Appeals file in whole or in part may be challenged by any person at any time during the pendency of an appeal.

(D) Submission of Motions. Motions in the Court of Appeals are submitted on Tuesday of each week. There is no oral argument on motions, unless ordered by the court.

(E) Decision on Motions.

(1) Except as provided in subrule (E)(2), orders may be entered only on the concurrence of the majority of the judges to whom the motion has been assigned.

(2) The chief judge or another designated judge may, acting alone, enter an order disposing of an administrative motion. Administrative motions include, but are not limited to:

(a) a motion to consolidate;

(b) a motion to extend the time to file a transcript or brief;

(c) a motion to strike a nonconforming brief;

(d) a motion for oral argument in a case that has not yet been placed on a session calendar;

(e) a motion to adjourn the hearing date of an application, complaint, or motion;

(f) a motion to dismiss a criminal appeal on the grounds that the defendant has absconded;

(g) a motion to file an amicus curiae brief;

(h) a motion to allow an out-of-state attorney to appear and practice.

(i) the date of signing the judgment or order, or the date of data entry of the judgment or order in the issuing tribunal’s register of actions, as applicable to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals under MCR 7.204 or MCR 7.205.

(ii) the filing date of any motion claimed to toll the time within which to appeal, the disposition of such a motion, and the date of entry of the order disposing of it;

(iii) in cases where appellate counsel is appointed, the date the request for appointment of appellate counsel was filed;

(iv) in cases where appellate counsel is retained or the party is proceeding in propria persona, the filing date of the claim of appeal or the date of the order granting leave to appeal or leave to proceed under MCR 7.206.

(b) If the order sought to be reviewed adjudicates fewer than all the claims, or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties, the statement must provide enough information to enable the court to determine whether there is jurisdiction.

(5) A statement of questions involved, stating concisely and without repetition the questions involved in the appeal. Each question must be expressed and numbered separately and be followed by the trial court’s answer to it or the statement that the trial court failed to answer it and the appellant’s answer to it. When possible, each answer must be given as “Yes” or “No”;

(6) A statement of facts that must be a clear, concise, and chronological narrative. All material facts, both favorable and unfavorable, must be fairly stated without argument or bias. The statement must contain, with specific page references to the transcript, the pleadings, or other document or paper filed with the trial court,

(a) the nature of the action;

(b) the character of pleadings and proceedings;

(c) the substance of proof in sufficient detail to make it intelligible, indicating the facts that are in controversy and those that are not;

(d) the dates of important instruments and events;

(e) the rulings and orders of the trial court;

(f) the verdict and judgment; and

(g) any other matters necessary to an understanding of the controversy and the questions involved;

(7) The arguments, each portion of which must be prefaced by the principal point stated in capital letters or boldface type. As to each issue, the argument must include a statement of the applicable standard or standards of review and supporting authorities, and must comply with the provisions of MCR 7.215(C) regarding citation of unpublished Court of Appeals opinions. Facts stated must be supported by specific page references to the transcript, the pleadings, or other document or paper filed with the trial court. Page references to the transcript, the pleadings, or other document or paper filed with the trial court must also be given to show whether the issue was preserved for appeal by appropriate objection or by other means. If determination of the issues presented requires the study of a constitution, statute, ordinance, administrative rule, court rule, rule of evidence, judgment, order, written instrument, or document, or relevant part thereof, this material must be reproduced in the brief or in an addendum to the brief. If an argument is presented concerning the sentence imposed in a criminal case, the appellant’s attorney must send a copy of the presentence report to the court at the time the brief is filed;

(8) The relief, stating in a distinct, concluding section the order or judgment requested;

(9) A signature; and

(10) A separately filed appendix, only as provided in section (J) of this rule.

(D) Appellee’s Brief; Contents.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subrule, the appellee’s brief must conform to subrule (C).

(2) The appellee must state whether the jurisdictional summary and the standard or standards of review stated in the appellant’s brief are complete and correct. If they are not, the appellee must provide a complete jurisdictional summary and a counterstatement of the standard or standards of review, and supporting authorities.

(3) Unless under the headings “Statement of Questions Involved” and “Statement of Facts” the appellee accepts the appellant’s statements, the appellee must include:

(a) a counter-statement of questions involved, stating the appellee’s version of the questions involved; and

(b) a counter-statement of facts, pointing out the inaccuracies and deficiencies in the appellant’s statement of facts without repeating that statement and with specific page references to the transcript, the pleadings, or other document or paper filed with the trial court, to support the appellee’s assertions.

(E) Briefs in Cross-Appeals. The filing and service of briefs by a cross-appellant and a cross-appellee are governed by subrules (A)-(D).

(F) Supplemental Authority. Without leave of the court, a party may file a one-page communication, titled “supplemental authority,” to call the court’s attention to new authority released after the party filed its brief. Such a communication,

(1) may not raise new issues;

(2) may only discuss how the new authority applies to the case, and may not repeat arguments or authorities contained in the party’s brief;

(3) may not cite unpublished opinions.

(G) Reply Briefs. Within 21 days after service of an appellee’s or cross-appellee’s brief, appellant or cross-appellant may file a reply brief confined to rebuttal of the arguments in the appellee’s or cross-appellee’s brief. Reply briefs are limited to no more than 3,200 words, but are otherwise governed by subrule (B). A self-represented party who does not have access to a word-processing system may file a typewritten or legibly handwritten reply brief of not more than 10 pages.

(H) Amicus Curiae.

(1) An amicus curiae brief may be filed only on motion granted by the Court of Appeals. The motion must be filed within 21 days after the appellee’s brief is filed. If the motion is granted, the order will state the date by which the brief must be filed.

(2) The brief is limited to the issues raised by the parties. An amicus curiae may not participate in oral argument except by court order.

(3) Except for briefs presented on behalf of amicus curiae listed in MCR 7.312(H)(2), a brief filed under this rule must indicate whether counsel for a party authored the brief in whole or in part and whether such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of the brief, and must identify every person other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, who made such a monetary contribution. The disclosure must be made in the first footnote on the first page of text.

(I) Nonconforming Briefs. If, on its own initiative or on a party’s motion, the court concludes that a brief does not substantially comply with the requirements in this rule, the court may order the party who filed the brief to file a supplemental brief within a specified time correcting the deficiencies, or it may strike the nonconforming brief.

(J) Appendix.

(1) Requirements. Except as provided in subrules (1)(a)-(f) of this rule, the appellant must file an individual or joint appendix with the appellant’s brief. An appellee may file an appendix with the appellee’s brief if the appellant’s appendix does not contain all the information set forth in subrule (3) of this rule. The appellee’s appendix should not contain any of the documents contained in the appellant’s appendix except when including additional pages to provide a more complete context, but should only contain additional information described in subrule (3) that is relevant and necessary to the determination of the issues on appeal. To avoid duplication in cases with more than one appellant or appellee, the parties are encouraged to submit a joint appendix under subsection (4) rather than separate appendixes. An appendix is not required in appeals from:

(a) Criminal proceedings.

(b) Child protective proceedings.

(c) Delinquency proceedings under chapter XIIA of the Probate Code.

(d) Adoption proceedings under chapter X.

(e) Involuntary mental health treatment proceedings under the Mental Health Code.

(f) The Michigan Public Service Commission where the record is available on the commission’s e-docket, or the Michigan Tax Tribunal where the record is available on the tribunal’s tax docket lookup page. In those cases, the parties’ briefs must cite the document number and relevant pages in the electronic record.

(2) Form. The appendix must include a cover page or pages with the case caption that sets forth the parties’ names and their designations (e.g., plaintiff-appellant), along with the appellate court and trial court or tribunal docket numbers. The cover page(s) must also state whether the appendix is an “Appellant’s Appendix,” “Appellee’s Appendix,” or “Joint Appendix.” Following the cover page(s), the appendix must include a table of contents that identifies each document with reasonable specificity and indicates both the appendix number or letter and the page number on which the first page of the document appears in the appendix. An appendix must be numbered sequentially in a prominent location at the bottoms of the pages. When the appendix is composed of multiple volumes, pagination must continue from one volume to the next. For multiple appendix volumes, each volume must include a cover page and table of contents, and the first volume must contain a complete table of contents referencing all volumes of the appendix.

(a) For an appendix filed in paper form, one signed copy that is separately bound from the brief must be filed. Each separate document in the appendix must be preceded by a title page that identifies the appendix number or letter and the title of the document. The binding method should allow the easy dismantling of the appendix for scanning.

(b) For an appendix filed electronically:

(i) The appendix must be separate from the electronically-filed brief and should be transmitted as a single PDF document unless the file size is too large to do so, in which case the appendix should be divided into separate volumes.

(ii) The appendix must be text searchable and include bookmarks for each document in the appendix and for important information or sections within the documents.

(iii) The table of contents should, if possible without unduly burdening the filer, link to the documents contained in the appendix or in that volume of the appendix.

(3) Content. The appendix must include copies of the following documents if they exist:

(a) The trial court or tribunal judgment or order(s) appealed from, including any written opinion, memorandum, findings of fact and conclusions of law stated on the record, in conjunction with the judgment or order(s) appealed from.

(b) The trial court or tribunal register of actions.

(c) The relevant pages of any transcripts cited in support of the argument. When appropriate, pages that precede or follow the cited page should be included to provide context to the citation. Submitting entire transcripts is discouraged unless necessary for the understanding of an argument. If a complete trial, deposition, or administrative transcript is filed, an index to such transcript must be included if one was provided by the court reporter. Transcripts must contain only a single transcript page per document page, not multiple pages combined on a single document page.

(d) When a jury instruction is challenged, the language of the instruction, any portion of the transcript containing a discussion of the instruction, and any relevant request for the instruction.

(e) Any other exhibit, pleading, or evidence that was submitted to the trial court and that is relevant and necessary for the Court to consider in deciding the appeal. Briefs submitted in the trial court are not required to be included in the appendix unless they pertain to a contested preservation issue.

(4) Joint Appendix.

(a) The parties may stipulate to using a joint appendix, so designated, containing the matters that are deemed necessary to fairly decide the questions involved. A joint appendix must meet the requirements of subrules (J)(2)and (3) and must be included with the initial appellant’s brief or, for a joint appendix of multiple appellees, with the first appellee’s brief to be filed.

(b) The stipulation to use a joint appendix may specify that any party may file, as a supplemental appendix, additional portions of the record not covered by the joint appendix.

Rule 7.213 Calendar Cases
(A) Mediation in Calendar Cases.

(1)    Selection for Mediation.

(a)    At any time during the pendency of an appeal before the Court of Appeals, the chief judge or another designated judge may order an appeal submitted to mediation. When a case is selected for mediation, participation is mandatory; however, the chief judge or another designated judge may remove the case on finding that mediation would be inappropriate. Appeals of domestic relations actions and protection matters are excluded from mediation under this rule.

(b)    To identify cases for mediation, the Court of Appeals will review civil appeals to determine if mediation would be of assistance to the court or the parties. At any time, a party to a pending civil appeal may file a written request that the appeal be submitted to mediation. Such a request may be made without formal motion and is confidential.

(c)    A party to a case that has been selected for mediation may file a request to have the case removed from mediation. Such a request may be made without formal motion and is confidential. If the request to remove is premised on a desire to avoid the cost of mediation, it is not necessary to demonstrate an inability to pay such costs.

(d)    The submission of an appeal to mediation will not toll any filing deadlines in the appeal unless the court orders otherwise.

(2)    Mediation Procedure.

(a)    Mediation must be conducted by a mediator selected by stipulation of the parties or designated by the court. A mediator designated by the court must be an attorney, licensed in Michigan, who has met the qualifications of mediators provided in MCR 2.411(F).

(b)    Mediation must consider the possibility of settlement, the simplification of the issues, and any other matters that the mediator determines may aid in the handling or disposition of the appeal.

(c)    The order referring the case to mediation must specify the time within which the mediation is to be completed. Within seven days after the time stated in the order, the mediator must file a notice with the clerk stating only the date of completion of mediation, who participated in the mediation, whether settlement was reached, and whether any further mediation is warranted.

(d)    If mediation results in full or partial settlement of the case, the parties must file, within 21 days after the filing of the notice by the mediator, a stipulation to dismiss (in full or in part) under MCR 7.218(B).

(e)    The mediator may charge a reasonable fee, which must be divided between and borne equally by the parties unless otherwise agreed and paid by the parties directly to the mediator. If a party does not agree on the fee requested by the mediator, on motion of the party, the chief judge or another designated judge must set a reasonable fee. In all other respects, mediator fees are governed by MCR 2.411(D).

(f)    The statements and comments made during mediation are confidential as provided in MCR 2.412 and may not be disclosed in the notice filed by the mediator under (A)(2)(c) of this rule or by the participants in briefs or in argument.

(g)    Upon failure by a party or attorney to comply with a provision of this rule or the order submitting the case to mediation, the chief judge or another designated judge may assess reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the failure, may assess all or a portion of appellate costs, or may dismiss the appeal.

(3)    Selection of Mediator.

(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the selection of a mediator is governed by MCR 2.411(B).

(b)    Within the time provided in the order referring a case to mediation, the parties may stipulate to the selection of a mediator. Such stipulation must be filed with the clerk of the court. If the parties do not file a stipulation agreeing to a mediator within the time provided, the court will appoint a mediator from the roster of approved mediators maintained by the circuit court in which the case originated.

(B) Notice of Calendar Cases. After the briefs of both parties have been filed, or after the expiration of the time for filing the appellee’s brief, the clerk must notify the parties that the case will be submitted as a “calendar case” at the next available session of the court.

(C) Priority on Calendar. The priority of cases on the session calendar is in accordance with the initial filing dates of the cases, except that precedence must be given to:

(1) interlocutory criminal appeals;

(2) child custody cases, guardianship cases under the Estates and Protected Individuals Code and under the Mental Health Code, and involuntary mental health treatment cases under the Mental Health Code;

(3) interlocutory appeals from the grant of a preliminary injunction;

(4) appeals from all cases involving election issues, including, but not limited to, recall elections and petition disputes;

(5) appeals of decisions holding that a provision of the Michigan Constitution, a Michigan statute, a rule or regulation included in the Michigan Administrative Code, or any other action of the legislative or executive branch of state government is invalid;

(6) actions brought under Const 1963, art 9, §§ 29-34 (Headlee actions); and

(7) cases that the court orders expedited.

(D) Arrangement of Calendar. Twenty-one days before the first day of the session, the clerk must send to all parties in each calendar case notice of the designated panel, location, day, and order in which the cases will be called.

(E) Adjournment. A change may not be made in the session calendar, except by order of the court on its own initiative or in response to timely motions filed by the parties. A calendar case will not be withdrawn after being placed on the session calendar, except on a showing of extreme emergency.

Rule 7.214 Argument of Calendar Cases
(A) Request for Argument. Oral argument of a calendar case is not permitted, except on order of the court, unless a party has stated on the title page of his or her brief in capital letters or boldface type “ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED.” The failure of a party to properly request oral argument or to timely file and serve a brief waives the right to oral argument. If neither party is entitled to oral argument, the clerk will list the case as submitted on briefs.

(B) Length of Argument. In a calendar case the time allowed for argument is 30 minutes for each side. When only one side is represented, only 15 minutes is allowed to that side. The time for argument may be extended by the court on motion filed at least 21 days before the session begins, or by the presiding judge during argument.

(C) Call for Argument. The court, on each day of the session, will call the cases for argument in the order they appear on the session calendar as arranged.

(D) Submission on Briefs. A case may be submitted on briefs by stipulation at any time.

(E) Decision Without Oral Argument. Cases may be assigned to panels of judges for appropriate review and disposition without oral argument as provided in this subrule.

(1) If, as a result of review under this rule, the panel unanimously concludes that

(a) the dispositive issue or issues have been recently authoritatively decided;

(b) the briefs and record adequately present the facts and legal arguments, and the court’s deliberation would not be significantly aided by oral argument; or

(c) the appeal is without merit;

the panel may enter without oral argument an appropriate order or opinion dismissing the appeal, affirming, reversing, or vacating the judgment or order appealed from, or remanding the case for additional proceedings.

(2) Any party’s brief may include, at the conclusion of the brief, a statement setting forth the reasons why oral argument should be heard.

Rule 7.215 Opinions, Orders, Judgments, and Final Process for Court of Appeals
(A) Opinions of Court. An opinion must be written and bear the writer’s name or the label “per curiam” or “memorandum” opinion. An opinion of the court that bears the writer’s name must be published by the Supreme Court reporter of decisions. A memorandum opinion must not be published. A per curiam opinion must not be published unless one of the judges deciding the case directs the reporter to do so at the time it is filed with the clerk. A copy of an opinion to be published must be delivered to the reporter no later than when it is filed with the clerk. The reporter is responsible for having those opinions published as are opinions of the Supreme Court, but in separate volumes containing opinions of the Court of Appeals only, in a form and under a contract approved by the Supreme Court. An opinion not designated for publication is deemed “unpublished.”

(B) Standards for Publication. A court opinion must be published if it:

(1) establishes a new rule of law;

(2) construes as a matter of first impression a provision of a constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, or court rule;

(3) alters, modifies, or reverses an existing rule of law;

(4) reaffirms a principle of law or construction of a constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, or court rule not applied in a reported decision since November 1, 1990;

(5) involves a legal issue of significant public interest;

(6) criticizes existing law;

(7) resolves a conflict among unpublished Court of Appeals opinions brought to the Court’s attention; or

(8) decides an appeal from a lower court order ruling that a provision of the Michigan Constitution, a Michigan statute, a rule or regulation included in the Michigan Administrative Code, or any other action of the legislative or executive branch of state government is invalid.

(C) Precedent of Opinions.

(1) An unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding under the rule of stare decisis. Unpublished opinions should not be cited for propositions of law for which there is published authority. If a party cites an unpublished opinion, the party must explain the reason for citing it and how it is relevant to the issues presented. A party who cites an unpublished opinion must provide a copy of the opinion to the court and to opposing parties with the brief or other paper in which the citation appears.

(2) A published opinion of the Court of Appeals has precedential effect under the rule of stare decisis. The filing of an application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court or a Supreme Court order granting leave to appeal does not diminish the precedential effect of a published opinion of the Court of Appeals.

(D) Requesting Publication.

(1) Any party may request publication of an authored or per curiam opinion not designated for publication by

(a) filing with the clerk a letter stating why the opinion should be published, and

(b) serving a copy on each party to the appeal not joining in the request.

Such a request must be filed within 21 days after release of the unpublished opinion or, if a timely motion for rehearing is filed, within 21 days after the denial of the motion.

(2) Any party served with a copy of the request may file a response within 14 days in the same manner as provided in subrule (D)(1).

(3) Promptly after the expiration of the time provided in subrule (D)(2), the clerk must submit the request, and any response that has been received, to the panel that filed the opinion. Within 21 days after submission of the request, the panel will decide whether to direct that the opinion be published. The opinion will be published only if the panel unanimously so directs. Failure of the panel to act within 21 days will be treated as a denial of the request.

(4) The Court of Appeals must not direct publication if the Supreme Court has denied an application for leave to appeal under MCR 7.305.

(E) Judgment.

(1) When the Court of Appeals disposes of an original action or an appeal, whether taken as of right, by leave granted, or by order in lieu of leave being granted, its opinion or order is its judgment. An order denying leave to appeal is not deemed to dispose of an appeal.

(2) The clerk must send a certified copy of the opinion or order, with the date of filing stamped on it, to each party and, in an appeal, to the court or tribunal from which the appeal was received. In criminal cases, the defendant’s lawyer must promptly send to the defendant a copy of any opinion or order disposing of an appeal or of any order denying leave to appeal. An opinion or order is notice of the entry of judgment of the Court of Appeals.

(F) Execution and Enforcement.

(1) Routine Issuance. Unless otherwise ordered by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court or as otherwise provided by these rules,

(a) the Court of Appeals judgment is effective after the expiration of the time for filing an application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court, or, if such an application is filed, after the disposition of the case by the Supreme Court;

(b) execution on the Court of Appeals judgment is to be obtained or enforcement proceedings had in the trial court or tribunal after the record has been returned (by the clerk under MCR 7.210(H) or by the Supreme Court clerk under MCR 7.310) with a certified copy of the court’s judgment or, if a printed record was not transmitted to the Court of Appeals, after the time specified for return of the record had it been transmitted.

(2) Exceptional Issuance. The court may order that a judgment described in subrule (E) has immediate effect. The order does not prevent the filing of a motion for rehearing, but the filing of the motion does not stay execution or enforcement.

(3) Reissuance of Judgment or Order. Any party may request that an opinion or order be reissued with a new entry date by filing a letter with the Court of Appeals setting forth facts showing that the clerk or attorney failed to send the judgment or order as provided in subrule (E)(2). The Court of Appeals will not reissue the opinion or order unless persuaded that it was not promptly sent as required and that the failure resulted in the party being precluded from timely filing a motion for reconsideration or an application for leave to appeal with the Supreme Court. Such request will be submitted to the Chief Judge for administrative decision, and the decision will be communicated by letter from the clerk.

(G) Entry, Issuance, Execution On, and Enforcement of All Other Orders. An order other than one described in subrule (E) is entered on the date of filing. The clerk must promptly send a certified copy to each party and to the trial court or tribunal. Unless otherwise stated, an order is effective on the date it is entered.

(H) Certain Dispositive Orders and Opinions in Criminal Cases; Expedited Notice to Prosecutor. In a criminal case, if the prosecuting attorney files a notice of a victim’s request for information and proof that copies of the notice were served on the other parties to the appeal, then, coincident with issuing an order or opinion that reverses a conviction, vacates a sentence, remands a case to the trial court for a new trial, or denies the prosecuting attorney’s appeal, the clerk of the court must electronically transmit a copy of the order or opinion to the prosecuting attorney at a facsimile number or electronic mail address provided by the prosecuting attorney in the notice.

(I) Reconsideration.

(1) A motion for reconsideration may be filed within 21 days after the date of the order or the date stamped on an opinion. The motion must include all facts, arguments, and citations to authorities in a single document and must not exceed 3,200 words or, for self-represented litigants without access to a word-processing system,10 double-spaced pages. A copy of the order or opinion of which reconsideration is sought must be included with the motion. Motions for reconsideration are subject to the restrictions contained in MCR 2.119(F)(3).

(2) A party may answer a motion for reconsideration within 14 days after the motion is served on the party. An answer to a motion for reconsideration must be a single document and not exceed 2,500 words or, for self-represented litigants without access to a word-processing system, seven double-spaced pages.

(3) The clerk will not accept for filing a motion for reconsideration of an order denying a motion for reconsideration.

(4) The clerk will not accept for filing a late motion for reconsideration.

(J) Resolution of Conflicts in Court of Appeals Decisions.

(1) Precedential Effect of Published Decisions. A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow the rule of law established by a prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued on or after November 1, 1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme Court, or by a special panel of the Court of Appeals as provided in this rule.

(2) Conflicting Opinion. A panel that follows a prior published decision only because it is required to do so by subrule (1) must so indicate in the text of its opinion, citing this rule and explaining its disagreement with the prior decision. The panel’s opinion must be published in the official reports of opinions of the Court of Appeals.

(3) Convening of Special Panel.

(a) Poll of Judges. Except as provided in subrule (3)(b), within 28 days after release of the opinion indicating disagreement with a prior decision as provided in subrule (2), the chief judge must poll the judges of the Court of Appeals to determine whether the particular question is both outcome-determinative and warrants convening a special panel to rehear the case for the purpose of resolving the conflict that would have been created but for the provisions of subrule (1). Special panels may be convened to consider outcome-determinative questions only.

(b) Effect of Pending Supreme Court Appeal. A poll must not be conducted and a special panel must not be convened if, at the time the judges are required to be polled, the Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal in the controlling case.

(c) Order. Immediately following the poll, an order reflecting the result must be entered. The chief clerk of the Court of Appeals must provide a copy of the order to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. The order must be published in the official reports of opinions of the Court of Appeals.

(4) Composition of Panel. A special panel convened under this rule consists of seven judges of the Court of Appeals selected by lot, except that judges who participated in either the controlling decision or the opinion in the case at bar may not be selected.

(5) Consideration of Case by Panel. An order directing the convening of a special panel must vacate only that portion of the prior opinion in the case at bar addressing the particular question that would have been decided differently but for the provisions of subrule (1). The special panel must limit its review to resolving the conflict that would have been created but for the provisions of subrule (1) and applying its decision to the case at bar. The parties are permitted to file supplemental briefs and are entitled to oral argument before the special panel unless the panel unanimously agrees to dispense with oral argument. The special panel must return to the original panel for further consideration any remaining unresolved issues, as the case may require.

(6) Decision. The decision of the special panel must be by published opinion or order and is binding on all panels of the Court of Appeals unless reversed or modified by the Supreme Court.

(7) Reconsideration; Appeal. There is no appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals as to whether to convene a special panel. As to the decision in the case at bar, the time limits for moving for reconsideration or for filing an application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court run from the date of the order declining to convene a special panel or, if a special panel is convened, from the date of the decision of the special panel, except that, if the case is returned to the original panel for further consideration in accordance with subrule (5), the time limits run from the date of the original panel’s decision after return from the special panel. If a motion for reconsideration is filed, it will be submitted to the special panel, which, if appropriate, may refer some or all the issues presented to the original panel.

Rule 7.216 Miscellaneous Relief
(A) Relief Obtainable. The Court of Appeals may, at any time, in addition to its general powers, in its discretion, and on the terms it deems just:

(1) exercise any or all the powers of amendment of the trial court or tribunal;

(2) allow substitution, addition, or deletion of parties or allow parties to be rearranged as appellants or appellees, on reasonable notice;

(3) permit amendment of or additions to the grounds for appeal;

(4) permit amendments, corrections, or additions to the transcript or record;

(5) remand the case to allow additional evidence to be taken;

(6) draw inferences of fact;

(7) enter any judgment or order or grant further or different relief as the case may require;

(8) if a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is set aside on appeal, grant a new trial or other relief as necessary;

(9) direct the parties as to how to proceed in any case pending before it;

(10) dismiss an appeal or an original proceeding for lack of jurisdiction or failure of the appellant or the plaintiff to pursue the case in conformity with the rules.

(B) Allowing Act After Expiration of Time. When any nonjurisdictional act is required to be done within a designated time, the Court of Appeals may permit it to be done after expiration of the period on motion showing that there was good cause for delay or that it was not due to the culpable negligence of the party or attorney.

(C) Vexatious Proceedings; Vexatious Litigator.

(1) The Court of Appeals may, on its own initiative or on the motion of any party filed under MCR 7.211(C)(8), assess actual and punitive damages or take other disciplinary action when it determines that an appeal or any of the proceedings in an appeal was vexatious because

(a) the appeal was taken for purposes of hindrance or delay or without any reasonable basis for belief that there was a meritorious issue to be determined on appeal; or

(b) a pleading, motion, argument, brief, document, record filed in the case or any testimony presented in the case was grossly lacking in the requirements of propriety, violated court rules, or grossly disregarded the requirements of a fair presentation of the issues to the court.

(2) Damages may not exceed actual damages and expenses incurred by the opposing party because of the vexatious appeal or proceeding, including reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages in an added amount not exceeding the actual damages. The court may remand the case to the trial court or tribunal for a determination of actual damages.

(3) Vexatious Litigator. If a party habitually, persistently, and without reasonable cause engages in vexatious conduct under subrule (C)(1), the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of another party, find the party to be a vexatious litigator and impose filing restrictions on the party. The restrictions may include prohibiting the party from continuing or instituting legal proceedings in the court without first obtaining leave, prohibiting the filing of actions in the court without the filing fee or security for costs required by MCR 7.209 or MCR 7.219, or other restriction the court deems just.

Rule 7.217 Involuntary Dismissal of Cases
(A) Dismissal. If the appellant, or the plaintiff in an original action under MCR 7.206, fails to order a transcript, file a brief, or comply with court rules, the clerk will notify the parties that the appeal may be dismissed for want of prosecution unless the deficiency is remedied within 21 days after the date of the clerk’s notice of deficiency. If the deficiency is not remedied within that time, the chief judge or another designated judge may dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution.

(B) Notice. A copy of an order dismissing an appeal for want of prosecution will be sent to the parties and the court or tribunal from which the appeal originated.

(C) Other Action. In all instances of failure to prosecute an appeal to hearing as required, the chief judge or another designated judge may take such other action as is deemed appropriate.

(D) Reinstatement.

(1) Within 21 days after the date of the clerk’s notice of dismissal under this rule, the appellant or plaintiff may seek relief from dismissal by filing a motion for reconsideration that shows mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

(2) The chief judge of the Court of Appeals will decide all untimely motions for reinstatement of an appeal.

Rule 7.218 Voluntary Dismissal
(A) Dismissal by Appellant. In all cases where the appellant or plaintiff in an original action under MCR 7.206 files an unopposed motion to withdraw the appeal, the clerk will enter an order of dismissal.

(B) Stipulation to Dismiss. The parties to a case in the Court of Appeals may file with the clerk a signed stipulation agreeing to dismissal of an appeal or an action brought under MCR 7.206. On payment of all fees, the clerk will enter an order dismissing the appeal or the action under MCR 7.206, except that class actions or cases submitted on a session calendar may not be dismissed except by order of the Court of Appeals.

Rule 7.219 Taxation of Costs; Fees
(A) Right to Costs. Except as the Court of Appeals otherwise directs, the prevailing party in a civil case is entitled to costs.

(B) Time for Filing. Within 28 days after the dispositive order, opinion, or order denying reconsideration is mailed, the prevailing party may file a certified or verified bill of costs with the clerk and serve a copy on all other parties. Each item claimed in the bill must be specified. Failure to file a bill of costs within the time prescribed waives the right to costs.

(C) Objections. Any other party may file objections to the bill of costs with the clerk within seven days after a copy of the bill is served. The objecting party must serve a copy of the objections on the prevailing party and file proof of that service.

(D) Taxation. The clerk will promptly verify the bill and tax those costs allowable.

(E) Review. The action by the clerk will be reviewed by the Court of Appeals on motion of either party filed within seven days from the date of taxation, but on review only those affidavits or objections that were previously filed with the clerk may be considered by the court.

(F) Costs Taxable. A prevailing party may tax only the reasonable costs incurred in the Court of Appeals, including:

(1) a charge of $1 per original page for the prevailing party’s costs associated with preparation of appellant’s brief, appellee’s brief, a supplemental brief or a reply brief, not including any attachments or appendices;

(2) any appeal or stay bond;

(3) the transcript and necessary copies of it;

(4) documents required for the record on appeal;

(5) fees paid to the clerk or to the trial court clerk incident to the appeal;

A person who is unable to pay a filing fee may ask the court to waive the fee by filing a motion and an affidavit disclosing the reason for the inability.

(H) Rule Applicable. Except as provided in this rule, MCR 2.625 applies generally to taxation of costs in the Court of Appeals.

(I) Violation of Rules. The Court of Appeals may impose costs on a party or an attorney for violation of these rules.

(6)   in an appeal from the Attorney Discipline Board, the decision is clearly erroneous and will cause material injustice.

(C) When to File.

(1) By pass Application. In an appeal before the Court of Appeals decision, the application must be filed within 42 days after:

(a) a claim of appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals;

(b) an application for leave to appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals; or

(c) an original action is filed in the Court of Appeals.

(a) the Court of Appeals order or opinion resolving an appeal or original action, including an order denying an application for leave to appeal,

(b) the Court of Appeals order or opinion remanding the case to the lower court or Tribunal for further proceedings while retaining jurisdiction,

(c) the Court of Appeals order denying a timely filed motion for reconsideration, or

(d) the Court of Appeals grants a request to publish an opinion that was originally released as unpublished.

Except as provided in subrules (C)(1) and (C)(2), the application must be filed within 28 days after a Court of Appeals order that does not resolve the appeal or original action, including an order granting an application for leave to appeal.

(4) Attorney Discipline Board Decision. In an appeal from an order of discipline or dismissal entered by the Attorney Discipline Board, the application must be filed within the time provided in MCR 9.122(A)(1).

(5) Decisions Remanding for Further Proceedings. If the decision of the Court of Appeals remands the case to a lower court for further proceedings, an application for leave to appeal may be filed within 42 days in civil cases and 56 days in criminal cases, after the date of

(a)   the Court of Appeals order or opinion remanding the case,

(b)   the Court of Appeals order denying a timely filed motion for reconsideration of a decision remanding the case, or

(c)   the Court of Appeals order or opinion disposing of the case following the remand procedure, in which case an application may be made on all issues raised initially in the Court of Appeals, as well as those related to the remand proceedings.

(6) Effect of Appeal on Decision Remanding Case. If a party appeals a decision that remands for further proceedings as provided in subrule (C)(6)(a), the following provisions apply:

(a)   If the Court of Appeals decision is a judgment under MCR 7.215(E)(1), an application for leave to appeal stays proceedings on remand unless the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court orders otherwise.

(b)   If the Court of Appeals decision is an order other than a judgment under MCR 7.215(E)(1), the proceedings on remand are not stayed by an application for leave to appeal unless so ordered by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.

(7) Orders Denying Motions to Remand. If the Court of Appeals has denied a motion to remand, the appellant may raise issues relating to that denial in an application for leave to appeal the decision on the merits.

(D) Answer. A responding party may file 1 signed copy of an answer within 28 days after service of the application in accordance with MCR 7.212(B). The party must file proof that a copy of the answer was served on all other parties.

(E) Reply. The appellant may file 1 signed copy of a reply within 21 days after service of the answer, along with proof of its service on all other parties. The reply must:

(1) contain only a rebuttal of the arguments in the answer;

(2) include a table of contents and an index of authorities; and

(3) be no longer than 3,200 words or, for self-represented litigants without access to a word-processing system, 10 pages, exclusive of tables, indexes, and appendixes.

(F)   Nonconforming Pleading. On its own initiative or on a party’s motion, the Court may order a party who filed a pleading that does not substantially comply with the requirements of this rule to file a conforming pleading within a specified time or else it may strike the nonconforming pleading. The submission to the clerk of a nonconforming pleading does not satisfy the time limitation for filing the pleading if it has not been corrected within the specified time.

(G)   Submission and Argument. Applications for leave to appeal may be submitted for a decision after the reply brief has been filed or the time for filing such has expired, whichever occurs first. There is no oral argument on an application for leave to appeal unless ordered by the Court under subrule (H)(1).

(H) Decision.

(1) Possible Court Actions. The Court may grant or deny the application for leave to appeal, enter a final decision, direct argument on the application, or issue a peremptory order. The clerk shall issue the order entered and provide either a paper copy or access to an electronic version to each party and to the Court of Appeals clerk.

(2)   Appeal Before Court of Appeals Decision. If leave to appeal is granted before a decision of the Court of Appeals, the appeal is thereafter pending in the Supreme Court only, and subchapter 7.300 applies.

(3)   Appeal After Court of Appeals Decision. If leave to appeal is denied after a decision of the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals decision becomes the final adjudication and may be enforced in accordance with its terms. If leave to appeal is granted, jurisdiction over the case is vested in the Supreme Court, and subchapter 7.300 applies.

(4) Issues on Appeal.

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, an appeal shall be limited to the issues raised in the application for leave to appeal.

(b) On motion of any party establishing good cause, the Court may grant a request to add additional issues not raised in the application for leave to appeal or not identified in the order granting leave to appeal. Permission to brief and argue additional issues does not extend the time for filing the brief and appendixes.

(I) Stay of Proceedings. MCR 7.209 applies to appeals in the Supreme Court. When a stay bond has been filed on appeal to the Court of Appeals under MCR 7.209 or a stay has been entered or takes effect pursuant to MCR 7.209(E)(7), it operates to stay proceedings pending disposition of the appeal in the Supreme Court unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals.

Rule 7.306 Original Proceedings
(A) Superintending Control. A complaint may be filed to invoke the Supreme Court’s superintending control power:

(2) over the Board of Law Examiners or the Attorney Grievance Commission.

When a dispute regarding court operations arises between judges within a court that would give rise to a complaint under this rule, the judges shall participate in mediation as provided through the State Court Administrator’s Office before filing such a complaint.

(2) 1 signed copy of a brief conforming as nearly as possible to MCR 7.212(B) and (C);

(3) proof that the complaint and brief were served on the defendant, and, for a complaint filed against the Attorney Discipline Board or Attorney Grievance Commission, on the respondent in the underlying discipline matter; for purposes of a complaint filed under Const 1963, art 4, § 6(19), service of a copy of the complaint and brief shall be made on any of the following persons: (1) the chairperson of the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission; (2) the secretary of the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission or (3) upon an individual designated by the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission or Secretary of State as a person to receive service.

(b) Proof that a copy of the answer was served on the plaintiff.

(E) Brief by Respondent in Action Against Attorney Grievance Commission or Attorney Discipline Board.

A response brief filed under this subsection shall conform to MCR 7.212(B) and (D).

(F) Reply Brief. 1 signed copy of a reply brief may be filed as provided in MCR 7.305(E). In an action filed under Const 1963, art 4, § 6(19), a reply brief may be filed within 3 days after service of the answer and supporting brief, unless the Court directs otherwise.

(G) Actions Against Attorney Grievance Commission; Confidentiality. The clerk shall keep the file in an action against the Attorney Grievance Commission or the grievance administrator confidential and not open to the public if it appears that the complaint relates to matters that are confidential under MCR 9.126. In the answer to a complaint, the grievance administrator shall certify to the clerk whether the matters involved in the action are deemed confidential under MCR 9.126. The protection provided in MCR 9.126 continues unless and until the Court orders otherwise.

(H) Nonconforming Pleading. On its own initiative or on a party’s motion, the Court may order a party who filed a pleading that does not substantially comply with the requirements of this rule to file a conforming pleading within a specified time or else it may strike the nonconforming pleading. The submission to the clerk of a nonconforming pleading does not satisfy the time limitation for filing the pleading if it has not been corrected within the specified time.

(I) Submission and Argument. Original proceedings may be submitted for a decision after service of the reply brief or the time for filing a reply brief has expired, whichever occurs first. There is no oral argument on an original complaint unless ordered by the Court.

(J) Decision. The Court may set the case for argument as a calendar case, grant or deny the relief requested, or provide other relief that it deems appropriate, including an order to show cause why the relief sought in the complaint should not be granted.

Rule 7.307 Cross-Appeal
(A) Filing. An application for leave to appeal as a cross-appellant may be filed with the clerk within 28 days after service of the application for leave to appeal. The cross-appellant’s application must comply with the requirements of MCR 7.305(A). A late application to cross-appeal will not be accepted.

(1) 1 signed copy of a motion and supporting papers, except as otherwise provided in this rule, stating briefly but distinctly the grounds on which the motion is based and the relief requested and including an affidavit supporting any allegations of fact in the motion;

(2) proof that the motion and supporting papers were served on each opposing party; and

(3) the fee provided by MCR 7.319(C)(2) or (3).

(B) Submission and Argument. Motions are submitted for decisions on Tuesday of each week at least 14 days after they are filed, but administrative orders (e.g., on motions to extend time for filing a pleading, to file an amicus brief, to appear and practice, to exceed the page limit) may be entered earlier to advance the efficient administration of the Court. There is no oral argument on a motion unless ordered by the Court.

(C) Answer. An opposing party may file 1 signed copy of an answer at any time before an order is entered on the motion.

(D) Motion to Seal File. Except as otherwise provided by statute or court rule, the procedure for sealing a Supreme Court file is governed by MCR 8.119(I). Materials that are subject to a motion to seal a file in whole or in part shall be held under seal pending the Court’s disposition of the motion.

(E) Motion for Immediate Consideration or to Expedite Proceedings. A party may move for immediate consideration of a motion or to expedite any proceeding before the Court. The motion or an accompanying affidavit must identify the manner of service of the motion on the other parties and explain why immediate consideration of the motion or expedited scheduling of the proceeding is necessary. If the motion is granted, the Court will schedule an earlier hearing or render an earlier decision on the matter.

(F) Motion for Rehearing.

(1) To move for rehearing, a party must file within 21 days after the opinion was filed:

(a) 1 signed copy of a motion for rehearing; and

(b) proof that a copy was served on each party.

The motion for rehearing must include reasons why the Court should modify its opinion and shall not exceed 16,000 words or, for self-represented litigants without access to a word-processing system, 50 double-spaced pages. Motions for rehearing are subject to the restrictions contained in MCR 2.119(F)(3).

(2) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, the timely filing of a motion for rehearing postpones issuance of the Court’s judgment order until the motion is either denied by the Court or, if granted, until at least 21 days after the filing of the Court’s decision on rehearing.

(3) Any party or amicus curiae that participated in the case may answer a motion for rehearing within 14 days after it is served by filing

(a) 1 copy of the answer; and

(b) proof that a copy was served on all other parties.

(4) Unless ordered by the Court, there is no oral argument on a motion for rehearing.

(5) The clerk shall refuse to accept for filing a late-filed motion for rehearing or a motion for reconsideration of an order denying a motion for rehearing.

(G) Motion for Reconsideration. To move for reconsideration of a court order, a party must file the items required by subrule (A) within 21 days after the date of certification of the order. The motion shall include all facts, arguments, and citations to authorities in a single document and shall not exceed 3,200 words or, for self-represented litigants without access to a word-processing system, 10 double-spaced pages. A copy of the order for which reconsideration is sought must be included with the motion. Motions for reconsideration are subject to the restrictions contained in MCR 2.119(F)(3). The clerk shall refuse to accept for filing a late-filed motion or a motion for reconsideration of an order denying a motion for reconsideration. The filing of a motion for reconsideration does not stay the effect of the order addressed in the motion.

(H) Motion to Expand Record in Cases Involving Termination of Parental Rights. In a case involving termination of parental rights, a respondent who claims ineffective assistance of appellate counsel under MCR 7.316(D) may file a motion to expand the record to support that claim if appellate counsel’s errors are not evident on the record. The motion must be filed no later than the date the application is due.

Rule 7.312 Briefs and Appendixes in Calendar Cases and Cases Argued on the Application
(A) Form and Length. Briefs in calendar cases and cases to be argued on the application must be prepared in conformity with subrule (B), MCR 7.212(B), (C), (D), and (G) as to form and length. If filed in hard copy, briefs shall be printed on only the front side of the page of good quality, white unglazed paper by any printing, duplicating, or copying process that provides a clear image. Typewritten, handwritten, or carbon copy pages may be used so long as the printing is legible.

(B) Citation of Record; Summary of Arguments.

(1) A party’s statement of facts or counterstatement of facts shall provide the appendix page numbers of the transcript pages, pleadings, or other documents being cited or referred to.

(2) If the argument of any one issue in a brief exceeds 6,500 words or, for selfrepresented litigants without access to a word-processing system, 20 pages, a summary of the argument must be included. The summary must be a succinct, accurate, and clear condensation of the argument actually made in the body of the brief and may not be a mere repetition of the headings under which the argument is arranged. The summary of argument is included in the brief’s word or page limit.

(C) Cover. A brief must have a suitable cover of heavy paper. The cover page must

follow this general form:

The individual or joint appendix must also include a copy of the Court of Appeals opinion or order being appealed but need not include the briefs submitted in the Court of Appeals unless they pertain to a contested preservation issue.

(E)   Time for Filing. Unless the Court directs a different time for filing,

(1)   the appellant’s brief and appendixes, if any, are due

(a) within 56 days of the order granting the application for leave to appeal, or

(1) file 1 signed copy of a brief and 1 set of appendixes with the clerk;

(2) serve 2 copies on each attorney who has appeared in the case for a separate party or group of parties and on each party who has appeared in person;

(3) serve 1 copy on the Attorney General in a criminal case or in a case in which the state is a named or interested party; and

(4) file a proof of service with the clerk.

(G) Cross-Appeal Briefs. The filing and service of cross-appeal briefs are governed by subrule (F). An appellee/cross-appellant may file a combined brief for the primary appeal and the cross-appeal within 35 days after service of the appellant’s brief in the primary appeal for both calendar cases and cases being argued on the application. An appellant/cross-appellee may file a combined reply brief for the primary appeal and a responsive brief for the cross-appeal within 35 days after service of the cross-appellant’s brief for both calendar cases and cases being argued on the application. A reply to the cross-appeal may be filed within 21 days after service of the responsive brief in a calendar case and within 14 days after service of the responsive brief in a case being argued on the application.

(H) Amicus Curiae Briefs and Argument.

(1) An amicus curiae brief may be filed only on motion granted by the Court except as provided in subsection (2) or as directed by the Court.

(2) A motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief (in both calendar cases and cases being argued on the application) is not required if the brief is presented by the Attorney General on behalf of the people of the state of Michigan, the state of Michigan, or an agency or official of the state of Michigan; on behalf of any political subdivision of the state when submitted by its authorized legal officer, its authorized agent, or an association representing a political subdivision; or on behalf of the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan or the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan.

(3) An amicus curiae brief must conform to subrules (A), (B), (C) and (F), and,

(4) Unless the Court directs a different time for filing, an amicus brief must be filed

(a) within 21 days after the brief of the appellee has been filed or the time for filing such brief has expired in a calendar case, or

(b) within 14 days after the brief of the appellee has been filed or the time for filing such brief has expired in a case being argued on the application.

(5) Except for briefs presented on behalf of amicus curiae listed in subrule (H)(2), a brief filed under this rule shall indicate whether counsel for a party authored the brief in whole or in part and whether such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of the brief, and shall identify every person other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, who made such a monetary contribution. The disclosure shall be made in the first footnote on the first page of text.

(6) An amicus curiae may not participate in oral argument except by Court order.

(I) Supplemental Authority. A party may file 1 signed copy of a supplemental authority in conformity with MCR 7.212(F).

(J) Extending or Shortening Time; Failure to File; Forfeiture of Oral Argument.

(1) The time provided for filing and serving the briefs and appendixes may be shortened or extended by order of the Court on its own initiative or on motion of a party.

(2) If the appellant fails to file the brief and appendixes within the time required, the Court may dismiss the case and award costs to the appellee or affirm the judgment or order appealed.

(3) A party filing a brief late forfeits the right to oral argument.

(K) For cases argued on the application, parties should focus their argument on the merits of the case, and not just on whether the Court should grant leave.

Rule 7.313 Supreme Court Calendar
(A) Definition. A case in which leave to appeal has been granted, or a case initiated in the Supreme Court that the Court determines will be argued at a monthly session, is termed a “calendar case.”

(B) Notice of Hearing; Request for Oral Argument.

(1) After the briefs of both parties have been filed or the time for filing the appellant’s reply brief has expired, the clerk shall notify the parties that the calendar cases and the cases to be argued on the application under MCR 7.305(H)(1) will be heard at a monthly session of the Supreme Court not less than 35 days after the date of the notice. The Court may direct that a case be scheduled for argument at a future monthly session with expedited briefing times or may shorten the 35-day notice period on its own initiative or on motion of a party.

(2) Except on order of the Court, a party who has not specifically requested oral argument on the title page of its brief or has forfeited argument by not timely filing its brief is not entitled to oral argument unless it files a motion for oral argument at least 21 days before the first day of the monthly session. If neither party is entitled to oral argument, the clerk will list the case as submitted on briefs. The Court may direct that a case be submitted on briefs without oral argument even when a party would otherwise be entitled to oral argument.

(C) Arrangement of Calendar. At least 21 days before the first day of the monthly session, the clerk will place cases on the session calendar and arrange the order in which they are to be heard. The cases will be called and heard in that order except as provided in subrule (D).

(D) Rearrangement of Calendar; Adjournment. At least 21 days before the first day of a session, the parties may stipulate to have a case specially placed on the calendar, grouped to suit the convenience of the attorneys, or placed at the beginning or end of the call. After that time, changes to the session calendar may be requested only by motion, not by stipulation of the parties. A motion to adjourn a case from the call after the schedule is released will be granted only by order upon a showing of good cause with an explanation of why the motion could not have been filed sooner. Costs payable to the Court may be imposed on the moving party for a late-filed motion to adjourn.

(E) Reargument of Undecided Calendar Cases. When a calendar case remains undecided at the end of the term in which it was argued, the parties may file supplemental briefs. In addition, by directive of the Court or upon a party’s written request within 14 days after the beginning of the new term, the clerk shall schedule the case for reargument. This subrule does not apply to a case argued on the application for leave to appeal under MCR 7.305(H)(1).

Rule 7.314 Call and Argument of Cases
(A)   Call; Notice of Argument; Adjournment From Call. The Court, on the first day of each monthly session, will call the cases for argument in the order they stand on the calendar as arranged in accordance with MCR 7.313(C), and proceed from day to day during the session in the same order. A case may not be adjourned after being placed on the call, except on a showing of extreme emergency. A case may be submitted on briefs by stipulation at any time.

(B)   Argument.

(1) In a calendar case in which one side is or both sides are entitled to oral argument, the time allowed for argument shall be provided in the order granting leave.

(2)   In a case being argued on the application for leave to appeal under MCR 7.305(H)(1), each side that is entitled to oral argument is allowed 15 minutes to argue unless the Court orders otherwise.

The time for argument may be extended by Court order on motion of a party filed at least 14 days before the session begins or by the Chief Justice during the argument.

Rule 7.315 Opinions, Orders, and Judgments
(A)   Opinions of Court. An opinion must be written and bear the authoring justice’s name or the label “Per Curiam” or “Memorandum Opinion.” Each justice deciding a case must sign an opinion. Except for affirmance of action by a lower court or tribunal by even division of the justices, a decision of the Court must be made by concurrence of a majority of the justices voting.

(B)   Filing and Publication. The Court shall file a signed opinion with the clerk, who shall stamp the date of filing on it. The reporter of decisions is responsible for having the opinions printed in a form and under a contract approved by the Court in accordance with MCR 7.301(E).

(C) Orders or Judgments Pursuant to Opinions.

(1) Entry. The clerk shall enter an order or judgment pursuant to an opinion as of the date the opinion is filed with the clerk.

(2) Routine Issuance.

(a) If a motion for rehearing is not timely filed under MCR 7.311(F)(1), the clerk shall send a certified copy of the order or judgment to the Court of Appeals with its file, and to the trial court or tribunal that tried the case with its record, not less than 21 days or more than 28 days after entry of the order or judgment.

(b) If a motion for rehearing is timely filed, the clerk shall fulfill the responsibilities under subrule (C)(2)(a) promptly after the Court denies the motion or, if the motion is granted, enter a new order or judgment after the Court’s decision on rehearing.

(3)   Exceptional Issuance. The Court may direct the clerk to dispense with the time requirement of subrule (C)(2)(a) and issue the order or judgment when its opinion is filed. An order or judgment issued under this subrule does not preclude the filing of a motion for rehearing, but the filing of a motion does not stay execution or enforcement.

(4)   Execution or Enforcement. Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, an order or judgment is effective when it is issued under subrule (C)(2)(a) or (b) or (C)(3), and enforcement is to be obtained in the trial court.

(D) Entry, Issuance, Execution, and Enforcement of Other Orders and Judgments. An order or judgment, other than those by opinion under subrule (C), is entered on the date of filing. Unless otherwise stated, an order or judgment is effective the date it is entered. The clerk must promptly send a copy or provide electronic notification of the order or judgment to each party, the Court of Appeals, and the trial court or tribunal. A motion may not be decided or an order entered by the Court unless all required documents have been filed and the requisite fees have been paid.

Rule 7.316 Miscellaneous Relief
(A) Relief Obtainable. While a matter is pending in the Supreme Court, the Court may, at any time, in addition to its general powers

(1) exercise any or all of the powers of amendment of the lower court or tribunal;

(2) on reasonable notice as it may require, allow substitution of parties by reason of marriage, death, bankruptcy, assignment, or any other cause; allow new parties to be added or parties to be dropped; or allow parties to be rearranged as appellants or appellees;

(3) permit the reasons or grounds of appeal to be amended or new grounds to be added;

(4) permit the transcript or record to be amended by correcting errors or adding matters that should have been included;

(5) adjourn the case until further evidence is taken and brought before it;

(6) draw inferences of fact;

(7) enter any judgment or order that ought to have been entered, and enter other and further orders and grant relief as the case may require;

(8) if a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is set aside on appeal, grant a new trial or other relief; or

(9) order an appeal submitted to mediation. The mediator shall file a status report with this Court within the time specified in the order. If mediation results in full or partial settlement of the case, the parties shall file, within 21 days after the filing of the notice by the mediator, a stipulation to dismiss (in full or in part) with this Court pursuant to MCR 7.318.

(B) Allowing Act After Expiration of Time. When, under the practice relating to appeals or stay of proceedings, a nonjurisdictional act is required to be done within a designated time, the Court may at any time, on motion and notice, permit it to be done after the expiration of the period on a showing that there was good cause for the delay or that it was not due to the culpable negligence of the party or attorney. The Court will not accept for filing a motion to file a late application for leave to appeal under MCR 7.305(C), a late application for leave to cross-appeal under MCR 7.307(A), a late motion for rehearing under MCR 7.311(F), or a late motion for reconsideration under MCR 7.311(G).

(C) Vexatious Proceedings; Vexatious Litigator.

(1) The Court may, on its own initiative or the motion of any party filed before a case is placed on a session calendar, dismiss an appeal, assess actual and punitive damages, or take other disciplinary action when it determines that an appeal or original proceeding was vexatious because

(a) the matter was filed for purposes of hindrance or delay or is not reasonably well-grounded in fact or warranted by existing law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or

(b) a pleading, motion, argument, brief, document, or record filed in the case or any testimony presented in the case was grossly lacking in the requirements of propriety, violated court rules, or grossly disregarded the requirements of a fair presentation of the issues to the Court.

(2) Damages may not exceed actual damages and expenses incurred by the opposing party because of the vexatious appeal or proceeding, including reasonable attorney fees, and punitive damages in an added amount not exceeding the actual damages. The Court may remand the case to the trial court or tribunal for a determination of actual damages.

(3) Vexatious Litigator. If a party habitually, persistently, and without reasonable cause engages in vexatious conduct under subrule (C)(1), the Court may, on its own initiative or on motion of another party, find the party to be a vexatious litigator and impose filing restrictions on the party. The restrictions may include prohibiting the party from continuing or instituting legal proceedings in the Court without first obtaining leave, prohibiting the filing of actions in the Court without the filing fee or security for costs required by MCR 7.209 or MCR 7.319, or other restriction the Court deems just.

(D) Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel Claims in Appeals Involving Termination of Parental Rights. If a respondent’s application for leave to appeal raises the issue of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the Court may consider the claim. In making its determination and in addition to any other action allowed by these rules or law, the Court may take the following actions:

(1) order the trial court to appoint new appellate counsel under MCR 3.993(D),

(2) allow the respondent time to retain new appellate counsel,

(3) grant a motion to expand the record under MCR 7.311(H), or

(4) remand the case to the Court of Appeals for a new appeal.

Rule 7.317 Involuntary Dismissal; No Progress
(A) Designation. If an appellant’s brief has not been timely filed under MCR 7.312(E)(1) or within the time period granted by an order extending the time for filing the brief, or if the appellant fails to pay the filing fee or pursue the case in substantial conformity with the rules, the case shall be designated as one in which no progress has been made.

(B) Notice; Dismissal. When a case is designated as one in which no progress is made, the clerk shall mail or provide electronic notice to each party notice that, unless the appellant’s brief that conforms with the rules is filed within 21 days or a motion is filed seeking further extension upon a showing of good cause, the case will be dismissed. An administrative order dismissing an action under this rule will be sent or made electronically accessible to the parties and the lower court or tribunal from which the action arose.

(C) Reinstatement. Within 21 days of the dismissal order, the appellant may seek reinstatement of the action by paying the filing fee or by filing a conforming brief along with a motion showing mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The clerk shall not accept a late-filed motion to reinstate.

(D) Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction. The Court may dismiss an appeal, application, or an original proceeding for lack of jurisdiction at any time.

Rule 7.318 Voluntary Dismissal
The parties may file with the clerk a stipulation agreeing to the administrative dismissal by the Chief Justice of an application for leave to appeal, an appeal, or an original proceeding in which leave has not been granted or argument has not been directed on the application. The Court may deny the stipulation in a matter scheduled, or to be scheduled, for oral argument if it concludes that the matter should be decided notwithstanding the stipulation. Costs payable to the Court may be imposed on the parties in the order granting the stipulated dismissal if the case has been scheduled for oral argument and the stipulation is received less than 21 days before the first day of the monthly session.

Rule 7.319 Taxation of Costs; Fees
(A)   Rules Applicable. The procedure for taxation of costs in the Supreme Court is as provided in MCR 7.219.

(B)   Expenses Taxable. Unless the Court otherwise orders, a prevailing party may tax only the reasonable costs incurred in the Supreme Court, including an amount not to exceed $2 per original page for the necessary expense of printing the briefs and appendixes required by these rules.

(C) Fees Paid to Clerk. The Clerk shall collect the following fees, which may be taxed as costs when costs are allowed by the Court:

(1) $375 for an application for leave to appeal or an original action;

(2) $150 for a motion for immediate consideration or a motion to expedite appeal, except that a prosecuting attorney is exempt from paying a fee under this subdivision in an appeal arising out of a criminal proceeding if the defendant is represented by a court-appointed lawyer;

(3) $75 for all other motions;

(4) 50 cents per page for a certified copy of a paper from a public record or a copy of an opinion;

(5) $5 for certified docket entries; and

(6) $1 for certification of a copy presented to the clerk.

A party who is unable to pay a filing fee may ask the Court to waive the fee by filing a motion and an affidavit disclosing the reason for that inability. There is no fee for filing the motion but, if the motion is denied, the party must pay the fee for the underlying filing.

(D)   Violation of Rules. The Supreme Court may impose costs on a party or an attorney when in its discretion they should be assessed for violation of these rules.
