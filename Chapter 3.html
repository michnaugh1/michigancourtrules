(c)    Conducting or causing to be conducted a diligent search for extended family members for placement.

(d)    Requesting representatives designated by the Indian child’s tribe with substantial knowledge of the prevailing social and cultural standards and child rearing practice within the tribal community to evaluate the circumstances of the Indian child’s family and to assist in developing a case plan that uses the resources of the Indian tribe and Indian community, including traditional and customary support, actions, and services, to address those circumstances.

(e)    Completing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of the Indian child’s family, including a determination of the likelihood of protecting the Indian child’s health, safety, and welfare effectively in the Indian child’s home.

(f)    Identifying, notifying, and inviting representatives of the Indian child’s tribe to participate in all aspects of the Indian child custody proceeding at the earliest possible point in the proceeding and actively soliciting the tribe’s advice throughout the proceeding.

(g)    Notifying and consulting with extended family members of the Indian child, including extended family members who were identified by the Indian child’s tribe or parents, to identify and to provide family structure and support for the Indian child, to assure cultural connections, and to serve as placement resources for the Indian child.

(h)    Making arrangements to provide natural and family interaction in the most natural setting that can ensure the Indian child’s safety, as appropriate to the goals of the Indian child’s permanency plan, including, when requested by the tribe, arrangements for transportation and other assistance to enable family members to participate in that interaction.

(i)    Offering and employing all available family preservation strategies and requesting the involvement of the Indian child’s tribe to identify those strategies and to ensure that those strategies are culturally appropriate to the Indian child’s tribe.

(j)    Identifying community resources offering housing, financial, and transportation assistance and in-home support services, in-home intensive treatment services, community support services, and specialized services for members of the Indian child’s family with special needs, and providing information about those resources to the Indian child’s family, and actively assisting the Indian child’s family or offering active assistance in accessing those resources.

(k)    Monitoring client progress and client participation in services.

(a)    “foster-care placement,” which shall mean any action removing an Indian child from his or her parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated,

Culturally appropriate services may involve tribal representatives, extended family members, tribal elders, spiritual and cultural advisors, tribal social services, individual Indian caregivers, medicine men or women, and natural healers.

Subchapter 3.100 Debtor-Creditor
Rule 3.101 Garnishment After Judgment
(A) Definitions. In this rule,

(1) “plaintiff” refers to any judgment creditor,

(2) “defendant” refers to any judgment debtor,

(3) “garnishee” refers to the garnishee defendant,

(4) “periodic payments” includes but is not limited to, wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, and other income paid to the defendant during the period of the writ; land contract payments; rent; and other periodic debt or contract payments. Interest payments and other payments listed in MCL 600.4012(14)(a)-(d) are not periodic payments.

(B) Postjudgment Garnishments.

(1) Periodic garnishments are garnishments of periodic payments, as provided in this rule.

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, a writ of periodic garnishment served on a garnishee who is obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant is effective until the first to occur of the following events:

(i) the amount withheld pursuant to the writ equals the amount of the unpaid judgment, interest, and costs stated in the verified statement in support of the writ; however, if the plaintiff has sent a statement to the garnishee in accordance with MCL 600.4012(5)(a), the balance on which may include additional interest and costs, the periodic garnishment is effective until the balance on the most recent statement is withheld or

(ii) the plaintiff files and serves on the defendant and the garnishee a notice that the amount withheld exceeds the remaining unpaid judgment, interest, and costs, or that the judgment has otherwise been satisfied.

(b) The plaintiff may not obtain the issuance of a second writ of garnishment on a garnishee who is obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant while a prior writ served on that garnishee remains in effect relating to the same judgment.

(c) If a writ of periodic garnishment is served on a garnishee who is obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant while another order that has priority under MCL 600.4012(2) is in effect, or if a writ or order with higher priority is served on the garnishee while another writ is in effect, the garnishee is not obligated to withhold payments pursuant to the lower priority writ until the higher priority writ ceases to be effective under subrule (B)(1)(a). However, in the case of garnishment of earnings, the garnishee shall withhold pursuant to the lower priority writ to the extent that the amount being withheld pursuant to the higher priority order is less than the maximum that could be withheld by law pursuant to the lower priority writ (see, e.g., 15 USC 1673). Upon the expiration of the higher priority writ, the lower priority one becomes effective until it ceases to be effective under subrule (B)(1)(a). The garnishee shall notify the plaintiff of receipt of any higher priority writ or order and provide the information required by subrule (H)(2)(c).

(2) Nonperiodic garnishments are garnishments of property or obligations other than periodic payments.

(C) Forms. The State Court Administrative Office shall publish approved forms for use in garnishment proceedings.

The disclosure filed in garnishment proceedings must be substantially in the form approved by the State Court Administrative Office.

(D) Request for and Issuance of Writ. The clerk of the court that entered the judgment shall review the request. The clerk shall issue a writ of garnishment if the writ appears to be correct, complies with these rules and the Michigan statutes, and if the plaintiff, or someone on the plaintiff's behalf, makes and files a statement verified in the manner provided in MCR 1.109(D)(3) stating:

(1) that a judgment has been entered against the defendant and remains unsatisfied;

(2) the amount of the judgment; the total amount of the postjudgment interest accrued to date; the total amount of the postjudgment costs accrued to date, which may include the costs associated with filing the current writ of garnishment; the total amount of the postjudgment payments made to date, and the amount of the unsatisfied judgment now due (including interest and costs), which may include the costs associated with filing the current writ of garnishment;

(3) that the person signing the verified statement knows or has good reason to believe that

(a) a named person has control of property belonging to the defendant,

(b) a named person is indebted to the defendant, or

(c) a named person is obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant.

(4) whether the garnishee is to make all payments directly to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney or to send the funds to the court.

(E) Writ of Garnishment.

(1) The writ of garnishment and the verified request for issuance of the writ must be included on the same form. The writ must include information that will permit the garnishee to identify the defendant, such as the defendant's address, social security number, employee identification number, federal tax identification number, employer number, or account number, if known.

(d) pay no obligation to the defendant, unless allowed by statute or court rule; and

(e) in accordance with subrule (J), either make all payments directly to the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney or send the funds to the court, as specified by the plaintiff in the request under subrule (D)(4).

(4) The writ shall direct the defendant to refrain from disposing of

(a) any negotiable instrument representing a debt of the garnishee (except the earnings of the defendant), or

(b) any negotiable instrument of title representing property in which the defendant claims an interest held in the possession or control of the garnishee.

(5) The writ shall inform the defendant that unless the defendant files objections within 14 days after the service of the writ on the defendant or as otherwise provided under MCL 600.4012,

(i) the value of all tangible or intangible property of the defendant that, before the writ is served on the garnishee, the garnishee received or held by conveyance, transfer, or title that was void as to creditors of the defendant, but that the garnishee no longer held at the time the writ was served, whether or not the defendant could maintain an action against the garnishee for the value of the property.

(2) The garnishee is liable for no more than the amount of the unpaid judgment, interest, and costs as stated in the verified statement requesting the writ of garnishment unless a statement is sent to the garnishee in accordance with MCL 600.4012(5)(a), in which case the garnishee is liable for the amount of the remaining judgment balance as provided in the most recent statement. Property or debts exceeding that amount may be delivered or paid to the defendant notwithstanding the garnishment.

(K) Objections.

(1) Objections shall be filed with the court within 14 days of the date of service of the writ on the defendant or within 14 days of the date of the most recent statement sent to the defendant pursuant to MCL 600.4012(5)(a). Objections may be filed after the time provided in this subrule but do not suspend payment pursuant to subrule (J) unless ordered by the court. Objections may only be based on defects in or the invalidity of the garnishment proceeding itself or the balance provided on the statement sent pursuant to MCL 600.4012(5)(a), and may not be used to challenge the validity of the judgment previously entered.

(2) Objections shall be based on one or more of the following:

(a) the funds or property are exempt from garnishment by law;

(b) garnishment is precluded by the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings;

(c) garnishment is barred by an installment payment order;

(d) garnishment is precluded because the maximum amount permitted by law is being withheld pursuant to a higher priority garnishment or order;

(e) the judgment has been paid;

(f) the garnishment was not properly issued or is otherwise invalid;

(g) the balance on the statement sent pursuant to MCL 600.4012(5)(a) is incorrect.

(4) The court shall notify the plaintiff, the defendant, and the garnishee of the court's decision.

(L) Steps After Disclosure; Third Parties; Interpleader; Discovery.

(1) Within 14 days after service of the disclosure, the plaintiff may serve the garnishee with written interrogatories or notice the deposition of the garnishee. The answers to the interrogatories or the deposition testimony becomes part of the disclosure.

(2) If the garnishee's disclosure declares that a named person other than the defendant and the plaintiff claims all or part of the disclosed indebtedness or property, the court may order that the claimant be added as a defendant in the garnishment action under MCR 2.207. The garnishee may proceed under MCR 3.603 as in interpleader actions, and other claimants may move to intervene under MCR 2.209.

(3) The discovery rules apply to garnishment proceedings.

(4) The filing of a disclosure, the filing of answers to interrogatories, or the personal appearance by or on behalf of the garnishee at a deposition does not waive the garnishee's right to question the court's jurisdiction, the validity of the proceeding, or the plaintiff's right to judgment.

(M) Determination of Garnishee’s Liability.

(1) If there is a dispute regarding the garnishee's liability or if another person claims an interest in the garnishee's property or obligation, the issue shall be tried in the same manner as other civil actions.

(2) The verified statement acts as the plaintiff's complaint against the garnishee, and the disclosure serves as the answer. The facts stated in the disclosure must be accepted as true unless the plaintiff has served interrogatories or noticed a deposition within the time allowed by subrule (L)(1) or another party has filed a pleading or motion denying the accuracy of the disclosure. Except as the facts stated in the verified statement are admitted by the disclosure, they are denied. Admissions have the effect of admissions in responsive pleadings. The defendant and other claimants added under subrule (L)(2) may plead their claims and defenses as in other civil actions. The garnishee's liability to the plaintiff shall be tried on the issues thus framed.

(3) Even if the amount of the garnishee's liability is disputed, the plaintiff may move for judgment against the garnishee to the extent of the admissions in the disclosure. The general motion practice rules govern notice (including notice to the garnishee and the defendant) and hearing on the motion.

(4) The issues between the plaintiff and the garnishee will be tried by the court unless a party files a demand for a jury trial within 7 days after the filing of the disclosure, answers to interrogatories, or deposition transcript, whichever is filed last. The defendant or a third party waives any right to a jury trial unless a demand for a jury is filed with the pleading stating the claim.

(5) On the trial of the garnishee's liability, the plaintiff may offer the record of the garnishment proceeding and other evidence. The garnishee may offer evidence not controverting the disclosure, or in the discretion of the court, may show error or mistakes in the disclosure.

(6) If the court determines that the garnishee is indebted to the defendant, but the time for payment has not arrived, a judgment may not be entered until after the time of maturity stated in the verdict or finding.

(N) Orders for Installment Payments.

(1) An order for installment payments under MCL 600.6201 et seq. suspends the effectiveness of a writ of garnishment of periodic payments for work and labor performed by the defendant from the time the order is served on the garnishee. An order for installment payments does not suspend the effectiveness of a writ of garnishment of nonperiodic payments or of an income tax refund or credit.

(2) If an order terminating the installment payment order is entered and served on the garnishee, the writ again becomes effective and retains its priority and remains in force as if the installment payment order had never been entered.

(O) Judgment and Execution.

(1) Judgment may be entered against the garnishee for the payment of money or the delivery of specific property as the facts warrant. A money judgment against the garnishee may not be entered in an amount greater than the amount of the unpaid judgment, interest, and costs as stated in the verified statement requesting the writ of garnishment. Judgment for specific property may be enforced only to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment against the defendant.

(2) The judgment against the garnishee discharges the garnishee from all demands by the defendant for the money paid or property delivered in satisfaction of the judgment. If the garnishee is sued by the defendant for anything done under the provisions of these garnishment rules, the garnishee may introduce as evidence the judgment and the satisfaction.

(3) If the garnishee is chargeable for specific property that the garnishee holds for or is bound to deliver to the defendant, judgment may be entered and execution issued against the interest of the defendant in the property for no more than is necessary to satisfy the judgment against the defendant. The garnishee must deliver the property to the officer serving the execution, who shall sell, apply, and account as in other executions.

(4) If the garnishee is found to be under contract for the delivery of specific property to the defendant, judgment may be entered and execution issued against the interest of the defendant in the property for no more than is necessary to satisfy the judgment against the defendant. The garnishee must deliver the property to the officer serving the execution according to the terms of the contract. The officer shall sell, apply, and account as in ordinary execution.

(5) If the garnishee is chargeable for specific property and refuses to expose it so that execution may be levied on it, the court may order the garnishee to show cause why general execution should not issue against the garnishee. Unless sufficient cause is shown to the contrary, the court may order that an execution be issued against the garnishee in an amount not to exceed twice the value of the specifically chargeable property.

(6) The court may issue execution against the defendant for the full amount due the plaintiff on the judgment against the defendant. Execution against the garnishee may not be ordered by separate writ, but must always be ordered by endorsement on or by incorporation within the writ of execution against the defendant. The court may order additional execution to satisfy the plaintiff's judgment as justice requires.

(7) Satisfaction of all or part of the judgment against the garnishee constitutes satisfaction of a judgment to the same extent against the defendant.

(P) Appeals. A judgment or order in a garnishment proceeding may be set aside or appealed in the same manner and with the same effect as judgments or orders in other civil actions.

(Q) Receivership.

(1) If on disclosure or trial of a garnishee's liability, it appears that when the writ was served the garnishee possessed,

(a) a written promise for the payment of money or the delivery of property belonging to the defendant, or

(b) personal property belonging to the defendant, the court may order the garnishee to deliver it to a person appointed as receiver.

(2) The receiver must

(a) collect the written promise for payment of money or for the delivery of property and apply the proceeds on any judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the garnishee and pay any surplus to the garnishee, and

(b) dispose of the property in an amount greater than any encumbrance on it can be obtained, and after paying the amount of the encumbrance, apply the balance to the plaintiff's judgment against the garnishee and pay any surplus to the garnishee.

(3) If the garnishee refuses to comply with the delivery order, the garnishee is liable for the amount of the written promise for the payment of money, the value of the promise for the delivery of property, or the value of the defendant’s interest in the encumbered personal property. The facts of the refusal and the valuation must be included in the receiver's report to the court.

(4) The receiver shall report all actions pertaining to the promise or property to the court. The report must include a description and valuation of any property, with the valuation to be ascertained by appraisal on oath or in a manner the court may direct.

(R) Costs and Fees.

(1) Costs and fees are as provided by law or these rules.

(2) Within 28 days after receipt of the disclosure filed pursuant to subrule (H) by a garnishee of a periodic garnishment disclosing that it does not employ the defendant and is not otherwise liable for periodic payments, or from a garnishee of a nonperiodic garnishment disclosing that it does not hold property subject to garnishment and the defendant is not indebted to the garnishee, the plaintiff shall deduct any costs associated with that garnishment that may have been added to the judgment balance pursuant to MCR 2.625(K), unless the court otherwise directs.

(S) Failure to Disclose or to Do Other Acts; Default; Contempt.

(1) For garnishments filed under MCR 3.101(B)(2) (nonperiodic):

(a) If the garnishee fails to disclose or do a required act within the time limit imposed, a default may be taken as in other civil actions. A default judgment against a garnishee may not exceed the amount of the garnishee's liability as provided in subrule (G)(2).

(b) If the garnishee fails to comply with the court order, the garnishee may be adjudged in contempt of court.

(2) For garnishments filed under MCR 3.101(B)(1) (periodic):

MCL 600.4012 (6)-(10) governs default, default judgments, and motions to set aside default judgments for periodic garnishments.

(3) The court may impose costs on a garnishee whose default or contempt results in expense to other parties. Costs imposed shall include reasonable attorney fees and shall not be less than $100.

(4) This rule shall not apply to nonperiodic garnishments filed for an income tax refund or credit.

(T) Judicial Discretion. On motion the court may by order extend the time for:

(1) the garnishee’s disclosure;

(2) the plaintiff’s filing of written interrogatories;

(3) the plaintiff’s filing of a demand for oral examination of the garnishee;

(4) the garnishee’s answer to written interrogatories;

(5) the garnishee’s appearance for oral examination; and

(6) the demand for jury trial.

The order must be filed with the court and served on the other parties.

(1) On a finding that the writ is available under this rule and that the affidavit states a sufficient basis for issuance of the writ, the judge to whom the action is assigned may issue the writ.

(2) The judge's order shall specify what further steps, if any, must be taken by the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the action and the attachment.

(ii) that the property will be damaged, destroyed, concealed, disposed of, or used so as to substantially impair its value, before trial.

(c) Adjournment. A court may not

(i) grant an adjournment of this hearing on the basis that a defendant has not yet answered the complaint or the motion filed under this subrule; or

(ii) allow a hearing on this motion if the hearing date has been adjourned more than 56 days with the assent of the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff files a new motion which includes recitations of any payments made by the defendant after the original motion was filed.

(4) Order for Custody Pending Final Judgment. After proofs have been taken on the plaintiff's motion for possession pending final judgment, the court may order whatever relief the evidence requires. This includes:

A bond required in a claim and delivery action must be approved by and filed with the court within the time the order provides.

(F) Seizure. A copy of an order issued under subrule (E)(4)(c) must be delivered to the sheriff or court officer, who must

(5) If the plaintiff takes a default judgment, the value of the property and the damages are determined under MCR 2.603. A defendant who appeared at a show-cause proceeding is deemed to have filed an appearance.

(7) The liability of a surety on a bond given under this rule may be determined on motion under MCR 3.604.

(I) Costs. Costs may be taxed in the discretion of the court. Costs may include the cost of a bond required by the court, and the costs of seizing and keeping the property.

(J) Execution.

(1) The execution issued on a judgment in a claim and delivery action must command the sheriff or court officer

(b) if the property described in the judgment is found in the possession of the defendant, to seize the property described in the judgment and deliver it to the prevailing party; or, if the property is not found in the possession of the defendant, to levy the value of it. The value may not exceed the total of the unpaid debt, costs, and damages.

Rule 3.110 Stockholders' Liability Proceedings
(A) Scope of Rule. This rule applies to actions brought under MCL 600.2909.

(B) When Action May Be Brought. An action against stockholders in which it is claimed that they are individually liable for debts of a corporation may not be brought until:

(1) a judgment has been recovered against the corporation for the indebtedness;

(2) an execution on the judgment has been issued to the county in which the corporation has its principal office or carries on its business; and

(3) the execution has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.

(C) Order for List of Stockholders. When the conditions set out in subrule (B) are met, the plaintiff may apply to the court that entered the judgment to order a list of stockholders. The court shall enter an order to be served on the secretary or other proper officer of the corporation, requiring the officer, within the time provided in the order, to file a statement under oath listing the names and addresses of all persons who appear by the corporation books to have been, or who the officer has reason to believe were, stockholders when the debt accrued, and the amount of stock held by each of them.

(D) Commencement of Action; Complaint. An action against the stockholders to impose personal liability on them for the debt of the corporation may be commenced and carried on as other civil actions under these rules. The complaint must, among other things, state:

(1) that the plaintiff has obtained a judgment against the corporation and the amount;

(2) that execution has been issued and returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, and the amount remaining unpaid;

(3) that the persons named as defendants are the persons listed in the statement filed by the officer of the corporation under subrule (C);

(4) the amount of stock held by each defendant, or that the plaintiff could not, with reasonable diligence, ascertain the amounts;

(5) the consideration received by the corporation for the debt on which judgment was rendered;

(6) a request for judgment against the stockholders in favor of the plaintiff for the amount alleged to be due from the corporation.

(E) Judgment Against Corporation As Evidence. At the trial the judgment against the corporation and the amount remaining unpaid are prima facie evidence of the amount due to the plaintiff but are not evidence that the debt on which the judgment was rendered is one for which the defendants are personally liable.

(F) Entry of Judgment Against Defendant. If a defendant admits the facts set forth in the complaint or defaults by failing to answer, or if the issues are determined against the defendant, judgment may be entered against him or her for the amount of the judgment against the corporation remaining unpaid, on proof that the debt is one for which that defendant is personally liable as a stockholder.

(G) Order of Apportionment; Execution. After judgment has been entered against all or some of the defendants, the court may apportion among these defendants the sum for which they have been adjudged liable pro rata according to the stock held by each. If any defendant fails to pay the amount apportioned against that defendant within 21 days, execution may issue as in other civil actions.

(H) Reapportionment. If execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part against any of the defendants as to whom apportionment has been made, the court has the power and the duty on application by the plaintiff to reapportion the sum remaining uncollected on the basis of subrule (G) among the remaining defendants adjudged liable. Execution may issue for the collection of these amounts.

(I) Contribution Among Stockholders. A stockholder who has been compelled to pay more than his or her pro rata share of the debts of the corporation, according to the amount of stock held, is entitled to contribution from other stockholders who are also liable for the debt and who have not paid their portions.

Rule 3.204 Proceedings Affecting Children
(A) Unless the court orders otherwise for good cause, if a circuit court action involving child support, custody, or parenting time is pending, or if the circuit court has continuing jurisdiction over such matters because of a prior action:

(1) A new action concerning support, custody or parenting time of the same child must be filed as a motion in the earlier action if the relief sought would have been available in the original cause of action. If the relief sought was not available in the original action, the new action must be filed as a new complaint.

(2) A new action for the support, custody, or parenting time of a different child of the same parents must be filed in the same county as the prior action if the circuit court for that county has jurisdiction over the new action and the new case must be assigned to the same judge to whom the previous action was assigned.

(3) Whenever possible, all actions involving the custody, parenting time, and support of children of the same parents shall be administered together. Unless the court finds that good cause exists not to do so, when the court enters a final order in a new action involving a new child of those parents, the order shall consolidate the provisions for custody, parenting time, and support for both that child and any children named in previous actions over which the court has jurisdiction involving the same parents. The order must reference the other cases and state that it supersedes the custody, parenting time, and support provisions of the orders entered previously in those cases. In the new action, the court may modify custody, parenting time, and support provisions in preexisting orders involving another child or children of the same parents, provided that the modification is supported by evidence presented in the new case and both parents have had an opportunity to be heard concerning the proposed modifications.

(B) When more than one circuit court action involving support, custody, or parenting time of a child is pending, or more than one circuit court has continuing jurisdiction over those matters because of prior actions, a complaint for the support, custody, or parenting time of a different child of the same parents must be filed in whichever circuit court has jurisdiction to decide the new action. If more than one of the previously involved circuit courts would have jurisdiction to decide the new action, or if the action might be filed in more than one county within a circuit:

(1) The new action must be filed in the same county as a prior action involving the parents’ separate maintenance, divorce, or annulment.

(2) If no prior action involves separate maintenance, divorce, or annulment, the new action must be filed:

(a) in the county of the circuit court that has issued a judgment affecting the majority of the parents’ children in common, or

(b) if no circuit court for a county has issued a judgment affecting a majority of the parents’ children in common, then in the county of the circuit court that has issued the most recent judgment affecting a child of the same parents.

(C) The court may enter an order that consolidates the custody, parenting time, and support provisions of multiple orders administratively when:

(1) the cases involve different children of the same parents but all other parties are the same, or

(2) more than one action involves the same child and parents.

The order must reference the other cases and state that it supersedes the custody, parenting time, and support provisions of the orders in those cases.

(D) In a case involving a dispute regarding the custody of a minor child, the court may, on motion of a party or on its own initiative, for good cause shown, appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child and assess the costs and reasonable fees against the parties involved in full or in part.

Rule 3.205 Prior and Subsequent Orders and Judgments Affecting Minors
(A) Jurisdiction. If an order or judgment has provided for continuing jurisdiction of a minor and proceedings are commenced in another Michigan court having separate jurisdictional grounds for an action affecting that minor, a waiver or transfer of jurisdiction is not required for the full and valid exercise of jurisdiction by the subsequent court.

(B) Notice to Prior Court, Friend of the Court, Juvenile Officer, and Prosecuting Attorney.

(1) As used in this rule, “appropriate official” means the friend of the court, juvenile officer, or prosecuting attorney, depending on the nature of the prior or subsequent court action and the court involved.

(2) If a minor is known to be subject to the prior continuing jurisdiction of a Michigan court, the plaintiff or other initiating party must send notice of proceedings in the subsequent court to

(a) the clerk or register of the prior court, and

(b) the appropriate official of the prior court.

(3) The notice must be sent at least 21 days before the date set for hearing. If the fact of continuing jurisdiction is not then known, notice must be sent immediately when it becomes known.

(4) The notice requirement of this subrule is not jurisdictional and does not preclude the subsequent court from entering interim orders before the expiration of the 21-day period, if required by the best interests of the minor.

(C) Prior Orders.

(1) Each provision of a prior order remains in effect until the provision is superseded, changed, or terminated by a subsequent order.

(2) A subsequent court must give due consideration to prior continuing orders of other courts, and may not enter orders contrary to or inconsistent with such orders, except as provided by law.

(D) Duties of Officials of Prior and Subsequent Courts.

(1) Upon receipt of the notice required by subrule (B), the appropriate official of the prior court

(a) must provide the subsequent court with copies of all relevant orders then in effect and copies of relevant records and reports, and

(b) may appear in person at proceedings in the subsequent court, as the welfare of the minor and the interests of justice require.

(2) Upon request of the prior court, the appropriate official of the subsequent court

(a) must notify the appropriate official of the prior court of all proceedings in the subsequent court, and

(b) must send copies of all orders entered in the subsequent court to the attention of the clerk or register and the appropriate official of the prior court.

(3) If a circuit court awards custody of a minor pursuant to MCL 722.26b, the clerk of the circuit court must send a copy of the judgment or order of disposition to the probate court that has prior or continuing jurisdiction of the minor as a result of the guardianship proceedings, regardless whether there is a request.

(4) Upon receipt of an order from the subsequent court, the appropriate official of the prior court must take the steps necessary to implement the order in the prior court.

Rule 3.206 Initiating a Case
(A) Information in Case Initiating Document.

(1) The form, captioning, signing, and verifying of documents are prescribed in MCR 1.109(D) and (E).

(2) Except for matters considered confidential by statute or court rule, in all domestic relations actions, the complaint or other case initiating document must state

(a) the allegations required by applicable statutes;

(b) the residence information required by statute; and

(c) the complete names of any minors involved in the action, including all minor children of the parties and all minor children born during the marriage, and for complaints for divorce, the ages of all children born of the marriage.

(3) When any pending or resolved family division or tribal court case exists that involves family members of the person(s) named in the case initiation document filed under subrule (2), the filing party must complete and file a case inventory listing those cases, if known. The case inventory is confidential, not subject to service requirements, and is available only to the party that filed it, the filing party’s attorney, the court, and the friend of the court. The case inventory must be on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office. This does not apply to outgoing requests to other states and incoming registration actions filed under the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, MCL 780.151 et seq. and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, MCL 552.2101 et seq.

(4) In an action for divorce, separate maintenance, annulment of marriage, or affirmation of marriage, regardless of the contentions of the parties with respect to the existence or validity of the marriage, the complaint also must state

(a) the names of the parties before the marriage;

(b) whether there are minor children of the parties or minor children born during the marriage;

(c) whether a party is pregnant;

(d) the factual grounds for the action, except that in an action for divorce or separate maintenance the grounds must be stated in the statutory language, without further particulars; and

(e) whether there is property to be divided.

(5) A party who requests spousal support in an action for divorce, separate maintenance, annulment, affirmation of marriage, or spousal support, must allege facts sufficient to show a need for such support and that the other party is able to pay.

(6) A party who requests an order for personal protection or for the protection of property, including but not limited to restraining orders and injunctions against domestic violence, must allege facts sufficient to support the relief requested.

(B) In a case in which the custody or parenting time of a minor is to be determined or modified, the filing party shall file a Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act Affidavit, on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office, as required by MCL 722.1209(1).

(C) Verified Statement and Verified Financial Information Form.

(1) Verified Statement. In an action involving a minor, or if child support or spousal support is requested, the party seeking relief must provide to the friend of the court a verified statement containing, at a minimum, personal identifying, financial, and health care coverage information of the parties and minor children. A copy of the Verified Statement must be served on the other party. The Verified Statement must be completed on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office.

(2) Verified Financial Information Form. Unless waived in writing by the parties, or unless a settlement agreement or consent judgment of divorce or other final order disposing of the case has been signed by both parties at the time of filing, and except as set forth below, each party must serve a Verified Financial Information Form (as provided by SCAO) within 28 days following the date of service of defendant’s initial responsive pleading. If a party is self-represented and his or her address is not disclosed due to domestic violence, the parties’ Verified Financial Information forms will be exchanged at the first scheduled matter involving the parties or in another manner as specified by the court or stipulated to by the parties. A party who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking by another party to the case, may omit any information which might lead to the location of where the victim lives or works, or where a minor child may be found. Failing to provide this Verified Financial Information form may be addressed by the court or by motion consistent with MCR 2.313. The Verified Financial Information form does not preclude other discovery. A proof of service must be filed when Verified Financial Information forms are served.

(3) The information in the Verified Statement and Verified Financial Information forms is confidential, and is not to be released other than to the court, the parties, or the attorneys for the parties, except on court order. For good cause, the addresses of a party and minors may be omitted from the copy of the Verified Statement and Verified Financial Information forms that are served on the other party. If a party excludes his or her address for good cause, that party shall either:

(a) submit to electronic filing and electronic service under MCR 1.109(G), or

(b) provide an alternative address where mail can be received.

(4) If any of the information required to be in the Verified Statement or Verified Financial Information forms is omitted, the party seeking relief must explain the reasons for the omission in those forms, or in a separate statement, verified under MCR 1.109(D)(3)(b) to be filed with the court by the due date of the form.

(5) A party who has served a Verified Financial Information form must supplement or correct its disclosure as ordered by the court or otherwise in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the Verified Financial Information form is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the action or in writing.

(6) When the action is to establish paternity or child support and the pleadings are generated from Michigan’s automated child support enforcement system, the party is not required to comply with subrule (C)(1), (C)(2), or MCR 3.211(F)(2). However, the party may comply with subrule (C)(1), (C)(2), or MCR 3.211(F)(2) to provide the other party an opportunity to supply any omissions or correct any inaccuracies.

(D) Attorney Fees and Expenses.

(1) A party may, at any time, request that the court order the other party to pay all or part of the attorney fees and expenses related to the action or a specific proceeding, including a post-judgment proceeding.

(2) A party who requests attorney fees and expenses must allege facts sufficient to show that

(a) the party is unable to bear the expense of the action, including the expense of engaging in discovery appropriate for the matter, and that the other party is able to pay, or

(b) the attorney fees and expenses were incurred because the other party refused to comply with a previous court order, despite having the ability to comply, or engaged in discovery practices in violation of these rules.

Rule 3.207 Ex Parte, Temporary, and Protective Orders
(A) Scope of Relief. The court may issue ex parte and temporary orders with regard to any matter within its jurisdiction, and may issue protective orders against domestic violence as provided in subchapter 3.700.

(B) Ex Parte Orders.

(1) Pending the entry of a temporary order, the court may enter an ex parte order if the court is satisfied by specific facts set forth in an affidavit or verified pleading that irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result from the delay required to effect notice, or that notice itself will precipitate adverse action before an order can be issued.

(2) The moving party must arrange for the service of true copies of the ex parte order on the friend of the court and the other party.

(3) An ex parte order is effective upon entry and enforceable upon service.

(4) An ex parte order remains in effect until modified or superseded by a temporary or final order.

“1. You may file a written objection to this order or a motion to modify or rescind this order. You must file the written objection or motion with the clerk of the court within 14 days after you were served with this order. You must serve a true copy of the objection or motion on the friend of the court and the party who obtained the order.

“2. If you file a written objection, the friend of the court must try to resolve the dispute. If the friend of the court cannot resolve the dispute and if you wish to bring the matter before the court without the assistance of counsel, the friend of the court must provide you with form pleadings and written instructions and must schedule a hearing with the court.

“3. The ex parte order will automatically become a temporary order if you do not file a written objection or motion to modify or rescind the ex parte order and a request for a hearing. Even if an objection is filed, the ex parte order will remain in effect and must be obeyed unless changed by a later court order.”

(6) In all other cases, the ex parte order must state that it will automatically become a temporary order if the other party does not file a written objection or motion to modify or rescind the ex parte order and a request for a hearing. The written objection or motion and the request for a hearing must be filed with the clerk of the court, and a true copy provided to the friend of the court and the other party, within 14 days after the order is served.

(a) If there is a timely objection or motion and a request for a hearing, the hearing must be held within 21 days after the objection or motion and request are filed.

(b) A change that occurs after the hearing may be made retroactive to the date the ex parte order was entered.

(7) The provisions of MCR 3.310 apply to temporary restraining orders in domestic relations cases.

(C) Temporary Orders.

(1) A request for a temporary order may be made at any time during the pendency of the case by filing a verified motion that sets forth facts sufficient to support the relief requested.

(2) A temporary order may not be issued without a hearing, unless the parties agree otherwise or fail to file a written objection or motion as provided in subrules (B)(5) and (6).

(3) A temporary order may be modified at any time during the pendency of the case, following a hearing and upon a showing of good cause.

(4) A temporary order must state its effective date and whether its provisions may be modified retroactively by a subsequent order.

(5) A temporary order remains in effect until modified or until the entry of the final judgment or order.

(6) A temporary order not yet satisfied is vacated by the entry of the final judgment or order, unless specifically continued or preserved. This does not apply to support arrearages that have been assigned to the state, which are preserved unless specifically waived or reduced by the final judgment or order.

Rule 3.208 Friend of the Court
(A) General. The friend of the court has the powers and duties prescribed by statute, including those duties in the Friend of the Court Act, MCL 552.501 et seq., and the Support and Parenting Time Enforcement Act, MCL 552.601 et seq.

Upon conclusion of the hearing, the referee shall sign the appropriate recommended order.

(4) A party may obtain a judicial hearing on any matter that has been the subject of a referee hearing and that resulted in a statement of findings and a recommended order by filing a written objection and notice of hearing within 21 days after the referee's recommendation for an order is served on the attorneys for the parties, or the parties if they are not represented by counsel. The objection must include a clear and concise statement of the specific findings or application of law to which an objection is made.

Rule 3.216 Domestic Relations Mediation
(A) Scope and Applicability of Rule, Definitions.

(1) All domestic relations cases, as defined in MCL 552.502(m), and actions for divorce and separate maintenance that involve the distribution of property are subject to mediation under this rule, unless otherwise provided by statute or court rule.

(2) Domestic relations mediation is a nonbinding process in which a neutral third party facilitates communication between parties to promote settlement. If the parties so request, and the mediator agrees to do so, the mediator may provide a written recommendation for settlement of any issues that remain unresolved at the conclusion of a mediation proceeding. This procedure, known as evaluative mediation, is governed by subrule (I).

(3) This rule does not restrict the Friend of the Court from enforcing custody, parenting time, and support orders.

(4) The court may order, on stipulation of the parties, the use of other settlement procedures.

(B) Mediation Plan. Each trial court that submits domestic relations cases to mediation under this rule shall include in its alternative dispute resolution plan adopted under MCR 2.410(B) provisions governing selection of domestic relations mediators, and for providing parties with information about mediation in the family division as soon as reasonably practical.

(C) Referral to Mediation.

(1) On written stipulation of the parties, on written motion of a party, or on the court's initiative, the court may submit to mediation by written order any contested issue in a domestic relations case, including postjudgment matters.

(2) The court may not submit contested issues to evaluative mediation unless all parties so request.

(3) Unless a court first conducts a hearing to determine whether mediation is appropriate, the court shall not submit a contested issue in a domestic relations action, including postjudgment proceedings, if the parties are subject to a personal protection order or are involved in a child abuse and neglect proceeding. The court may order mediation without a hearing if a protected party requests mediation.

(D) Objections to Referral to Mediation.

(1) To object to mediation, a party must file a written motion to remove the case from mediation and a notice of hearing of the motion, and serve a copy on the attorneys of record within 14 days after receiving notice of the order assigning the action to mediation. The motion must be set for hearing within 14 days after it is filed, unless the hearing is adjourned by agreement of counsel or unless the court orders otherwise.

(2) A timely motion must be heard before the case is mediated.

(3) Cases may be exempt from mediation on the basis of the following:

(a) child abuse or neglect;

(b) domestic abuse, unless attorneys for both parties will be present at the mediation session;

(c) inability of one or both parties to negotiate for themselves at the mediation, unless attorneys for both parties will be present at the mediation session;

(d) reason to believe that one or both parties' health or safety would be endangered by mediation; or

(e) for other good cause shown.

(E) Selection of Mediator.

(1) Domestic relations mediation will be conducted by a mediator selected as provided in this subrule.

(2) The parties may stipulate to the selection of a mediator. A mediator selected by agreement of the parties need not meet the qualifications set forth in subrule (G). The court must appoint a mediator stipulated to by the parties, provided the mediator is willing to serve within a period that would not interfere with the court's scheduling of the case for trial.

(3) If the parties have not stipulated to a mediator:

(a) the parties must indicate whether they prefer a mediator who is willing to conduct evaluative mediation. Failure to indicate a preference will be treated as not requesting evaluative mediation.

(b) the ADR clerk will assign a mediator from the list of qualified mediators maintained under subrule (F). The assignment shall be made on a rotational basis, except that if the parties have requested evaluative mediation, only a mediator who is willing to provide an evaluation may be assigned.

(4) The court shall not appoint, recommend, direct, or otherwise influence a party’s or attorney’s selection of a mediator except as provided pursuant to this rule. The court may recommend or advise parties on the selection of a mediator only upon request of all parties by stipulation in writing or orally on the record.

(5) The rule for disqualification of a mediator is the same as that provided in MCR 2.003 for the disqualification of a judge. The mediator must promptly disclose any potential basis for disqualification.

(F) List of Mediators.

(1) Application. To appear on a roster, an applicant, which may be an individual or organization, may apply to the ADR clerk to be placed on the court's list of mediators. Application forms shall be available in the office of the ADR clerk.

(c) The form shall include an optional section identifying the applicant's gender and racial/ethnic background; however, this section shall not be made available to the public.

(2) Review of Applications. The court's ADR plan shall provide for a person or committee to review applications annually, or more frequently if appropriate, and compile a list of qualified mediators.

(a) Applicants meeting the qualifications specified in this rule shall be placed on the list of approved mediators. Approved mediators shall be placed on the list for a fixed period of time, not to exceed seven years, and must reapply at the end of that time in the manner directed by the court.

(b) Selections shall be made without regard to race, ethnic origin, or gender. Residency or principal place of business may not be a qualification.

(c) The approved list and the applications of approved mediators, except for the optional section identifying the applicant's gender and racial/ethnic background, shall be available to the public in the office of the ADR clerk.

(d) An applicant may attach a résumé or biographical information to the application.

(e) An applicant Community Dispute Resolution Program center must select only mediators who meet the qualifications of this rule or training requirements established by the State Court Administrator to mediate cases ordered by the court.

(3) Rejection; Reconsideration. Applicants who are not placed on the list shall be notified of that decision. Within 21 days of notification of the decision to reject an application, the applicant may seek reconsideration of the ADR clerk's decision by the presiding judge of the family division. The court does not need to provide a hearing. Documents considered in the initial review process shall be retained for at least the period during which the applicant can seek reconsideration of the original decision.

(4) Removal from List. The ADR clerk may remove from the list mediators who have demonstrated incompetence, bias, made themselves consistently unavailable to serve as a mediator, or for other just cause. Within 21 days of notification of the decision to remove a mediator from the list, the mediator may seek reconsideration of the ADR clerk's decision by the presiding judge of the family division. The court does not need to provide a hearing.

(G) Qualification of Mediators.

(1) To be eligible to serve as a domestic relations mediator under this rule, an applicant must meet the following minimum qualifications:

(a) The applicant must

(i) be a licensed attorney, a licensed or limited licensed psychologist, a licensed professional counselor, or a licensed marriage and family therapist;

(3) Approved mediators are required to obtain 8 hours of advanced mediation training during each 2-year period. Failure to submit documentation establishing compliance is grounds for removal from the list under subrule(F)(4).

(4) Additional qualifications may not be imposed upon mediators.

(H) Mediation Procedure.

(1) The mediator must schedule a mediation session within a reasonable time at a location accessible by the parties.

(2) The mediator must make reasonable inquiry as to whether either party has a history of a coercive or violent relationship with the other party. Throughout the mediation process, the mediator must make reasonable efforts to screen for the presence of coercion or violence that would make mediation physically or emotionally unsafe for any participant or that would impede achieving a voluntary and safe resolution of issues. A reasonable inquiry includes the use of the domestic violence screening protocol for mediators provided by the state court administrative office as directed by the supreme court.

(3) A mediator may require that no later than 3 business days before the mediation session, each party submit to the mediator, and serve on the opposing party, a mediation summary that provides the following information, where relevant:

(a) the facts and circumstances of the case;

(b) the issues in dispute;

(c) a description of the marital assets and their estimated value, where such information is appropriate and reasonably ascertainable;

(d) the income and expenses of the parties;

(e) a proposed settlement; and

(f) such documentary evidence as may be available to substantiate information contained in the summary.

Failure to submit these materials to the mediator within the designated time may subject the offending party to sanctions imposed by the court.

(4) The parties must attend the mediation session in person unless excused by the mediator.

(5) Except for legal counsel, the parties may not bring other persons to the mediation session, whether expert or lay witnesses, unless permission is first obtained from the mediator, after notice to opposing counsel. If the mediator believes it would be helpful to the settlement of the case, the mediator may request information or assistance from third persons at the time of the mediation session.

(6) The mediator shall discuss with the parties and counsel, if any, the facts and issues involved. The mediation will continue until a settlement is reached, the mediator determines that a settlement is not likely to be reached, the end of the first mediation session, or until a time agreed to by the parties.

(7) Within 7 days of the completion of mediation, the mediator shall so advise the court, stating only the date of completion of the process, who participated in the mediation, whether settlement was reached, and whether further ADR proceedings are contemplated. If an evaluation will be made under subrule (I), the mediator may delay reporting to the court until completion of the evaluation process.

(8) If a settlement is reached as a result of the mediation, to be binding, the terms of that settlement must be reduced to a signed writing by the parties or acknowledged by the parties on an audio or video recording. After a settlement has been reached, the parties shall take steps necessary to enter judgment as in the case of other settlements.

(9) Confidentiality in the mediation process is governed by MCR 2.412.

(I) Evaluative Mediation.

(1) This subrule applies if the parties requested evaluative mediation, or if they do so at the conclusion of mediation and the mediator is willing to provide an evaluation.

(2) If a settlement is not reached during mediation, the mediator, within a reasonable period after the conclusion of mediation shall prepare a written report to the parties setting forth the mediator's proposed recommendation for settlement purposes only. The mediator's recommendation shall be submitted to the parties of record only and may not be submitted or made available to the court.

(3) If both parties accept the mediator's recommendation in full, the attorneys shall proceed to have a judgment entered in conformity with the recommendation.

(4) If the mediator's recommendation is not accepted in full by both parties and the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the remaining contested issues, mediator shall report to the court under subrule (H)(6), and the case shall proceed toward trial.

(5) A court may not impose sanctions against either party for rejecting the mediator's recommendation. The court may not inquire and neither the parties nor the mediator may inform the court of the identity of the party or parties who rejected the mediator's recommendation.

(6) The mediator's report and recommendation may not be read by the court and may not be admitted into evidence or relied upon by the court as evidence of any of the information contained in it without the consent of both parties. The court shall not request the parties' consent to read the mediator's recommendation.

(J) Fees.

(1) A mediator is entitled to reasonable compensation based on an hourly rate commensurate with the mediator's experience and usual charges for services performed.

(2) Before mediation, the parties shall agree in writing that each shall pay one-half of the mediator's fee no later than:

(a) 42 days after the mediation process is concluded or the service of the mediator's report and recommendation under subrule (I)(2), or

(b) the entry of judgment, or

(c) the dismissal of the action, whichever occurs first. If the court finds that some other allocation of fees is appropriate, given the economic circumstances of the parties, the court may order that one of the parties pay more than one-half of the fee.

(3) If acceptable to the mediator, the court may order an arrangement for the payment of the mediator's fee other than that provided in subrule (J)(2).

(4) The mediator's fee is deemed a cost of the action, and the court may make an appropriate judgment under MCL 552.13(1) to enforce the payment of the fee.

(5) In the event either party objects to the total fee of the mediator, the matter may be scheduled before the trial judge for determination of the reasonableness of the fee.

(K) Standards of Conduct. The State Court Administrator shall develop and approve standards of conduct for domestic relations mediators designed to promote honesty, integrity, and impartiality in providing court-connected dispute resolution services. These standards shall be made a part of all training and educational requirements for court-connected programs, shall be provided to all mediators involved in court-connected programs, and shall be available to the public.

(B) Blood or Tissue Typing Tests. A petition for blood or tissue typing tests under MCL 722.716 must be filed at or before the pretrial conference or, if a pretrial conference is not held, within the time specified by the court.

(1) The summons issued under MCL 722.714 must include a form advising the alleged father of the right to an attorney as described in subrule (C)(2), and the procedure for requesting the appointment of an attorney.

(2) If the alleged father appears in court following the issuance of a summons under MCL 722.714, the court must personally advise him that he is entitled to the assistance of an attorney, and that the court will appoint an attorney at public expense, at his request, if he is financially unable to retain an attorney of his choice.

(3) If the alleged father indicates that he wants to proceed without an attorney, the record must affirmatively show that he was given the advice required by subrule (C)(2) and that he waived the right to counsel.

(4) If the alleged father does not appear in court following the issuance of a summons under MCL 722.714, subrule (C)(3) does not apply.

(D) Visitation Rights of Noncustodial Parent.

(1) On the petition of either party, the court may provide in the order of filiation for such reasonable visitation by the noncustodial parent as the court deems justified and in the best interests of the child.

(2) Emergency Release. If a person is ordered released from custody as a result of a court order or law requiring the release of prisoners to relieve jail conditions, the court ordering the release shall impose conditions of release in accordance with this rule to ensure the appearance of the individual as required.

(a) decide the contested matter to the extent the parties do not dispute the issues or facts in the report or to the extent that the contested issues and facts are not material to the court’s decision; or

(b) if the parties dispute any issues or facts in the report, the court must make an independent determination based on evidence and testimony presented at the hearing or a subsequent hearing.

(b) the person will complete the requirements within a reasonable time determined by the SCAO.

(1) At the time that a complaint is filed, or any time after establishing paternity or a duty to support a child, the IV-D agency may provide notice setting a proposed support amount. The proposed support obligation shall be calculated by application of the Michigan Child Support Formula or a properly documented deviation from the amount calculated using the formula.

(1) The court may consider the complaints and other documents filed with the court, relevant and material affidavits, or other evidence when entering an order in an expedited paternity or support action.

Subchapter 3.300 Extraordinary Writs
Rule 3.301 Extraordinary Writs in General
(A) Applicability and Scope of Rules.

(1) A civil action or appropriate motion in a pending action may be brought to obtain

(a) superintending control,

(b) habeas corpus,

(c) mandamus, or

(d) quo warranto.

Unless a particular rule or statute specifically provides otherwise, an original action may not be commenced in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals if the circuit court would have jurisdiction of an action seeking that relief.

(2) These special rules govern the procedure for seeking the writs or relief formerly obtained by the writs, whether the right to relief is created by statute or common law. If the right to relief is created by statute, the limitations on relief in the statute apply, as well as the limitations on relief in these rules.

(3) The general rules of procedure apply except as otherwise provided in this subchapter.

(B) Joinder of Claims. More than one kind of writ may be sought in an action either as an independent claim or as an alternative claim. Subject to MCR 2.203, other claims may be joined in an action for a writ or writs.

(C) Process; Service of Writs. Process must be issued and served as in other civil actions. However, if a writ, order, or order to show cause is issued before service of process, then service of the writ, order, or order to show cause in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.105, accompanied by a copy of the complaint, makes service of other process unnecessary.

(D) Assignment for Trial. Actions brought under these special rules may be given precedence under MCR 2.501(B).

(E) Records. The action taken on applications for writs or orders to show cause must be noted in court records in the same manner as actions taken in other civil actions.

(F) No Automatic Stay. The automatic stay provisions of MCR 2.614(A) do not apply to judgments in actions brought under this subchapter.

(G) Procedure Where Relief Is Sought in Supreme Court or Court of Appeals.

(1) MCR 7.306 applies to original proceedings brought in the Supreme Court to obtain relief under this subchapter.

(2) MCR 7.206 applies to original proceedings brought in the Court of Appeals to obtain relief under this subchapter.

Rule 3.302 Superintending Control
(A) Scope. A superintending control order enforces the superintending control power of a court over lower courts or tribunals.

(B) Policy Concerning Use. If another adequate remedy is available to the party seeking the order, a complaint for superintending control may not be filed. See subrule (D)(2), and MCR 7.101(A)(2), and 7.306(A).

(C) Writs Superseded. A superintending control order replaces the writs of certiorari and prohibition and the writ of mandamus when directed to a lower court or tribunal.

(D) Jurisdiction.

(1) The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the circuit court have jurisdiction to issue superintending control orders to lower courts or tribunals.

(2) When an appeal in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or the circuit court is available, that method of review must be used. If superintending control is sought and an appeal is available, the complaint for superintending control must be dismissed.

(E) Procedure for Superintending Control in Circuit Court.

(1) Complaint. A person seeking superintending control in the circuit court must file a complaint with the court. Only the plaintiff's name may appear in the title of the action (for example, In re Smith). The plaintiff must serve a copy of the complaint on the court or tribunal over which superintending control is sought. If the superintending control action arises out of a particular action, a copy of the complaint must also be served on each other party to the proceeding in that court or tribunal.

(2) Answer. Anyone served under subrule (E)(1) may file an answer within 21 days after the complaint is served.

(3) Issuance of Order; Dismissal.

(a) After the filing of a complaint and answer or, if no answer is filed, after expiration of the time for filing an answer, the court may

(i) issue an order to show cause why the order requested should not be issued,

(ii) issue the order requested, or

(iii) dismiss the complaint.

(b) If a need for immediate action is shown, the court may enter an order before an answer is filed.

(c) The court may require in an order to show cause that additional records and documents be filed.

(d) An order to show cause must specify the date for hearing the complaint.

Rule 3.303 Habeas Corpus to Inquire Into Cause of Detention
(A) Jurisdiction and Venue; Persons Detained on Criminal Charges.

(1) An action for habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of detention of a person may be brought in any court of record except the probate court.

(2) The action must be brought in the county in which the prisoner is detained. If it is shown that there is no judge in that county empowered and available to issue the writ or that the judicial circuit for that county has refused to issue the writ, the action may be brought in the Court of Appeals.

(3) A prisoner detained in a county jail for a criminal charge, who has not been sentenced to detention by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be removed from detention by a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of detention only if the writ is issued by the court in which the prisoner would next appear if the criminal process against the prisoner continued, or by the judicial circuit for the county in which the prisoner is detained. This subrule does not limit the power of the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court to issue the writ.

(B) Who May Bring. An action for habeas corpus may be brought by the prisoner or by another person on the prisoner's behalf.

(C) Complaint. The complaint must state:

(1) that the person on whose behalf the writ is applied for (the prisoner) is restrained of his or her liberty;

(2) the name, if known, or the description of the prisoner;

(3) the name, if known, or the description of the officer or person by whom the prisoner is restrained;

(4) the place of restraint, if known;

(5) that the action for habeas corpus by or on behalf of the prisoner is not prohibited;

(6) the cause or pretense of the restraint, according to the plaintiff's best knowledge and belief; and

(7) why the restraint is illegal.

(D) Issuance of the Writ or Order to Show Cause.

(1) On the filing of the complaint, the court may issue

(a) a writ of habeas corpus directed to the person having custody of the prisoner, or that person's superior, ordering him or her to bring the prisoner before the court forthwith; or

(b) an order to show cause why the writ should not be issued, unless it appears that the prisoner is not entitled to relief.

(2) On the showing required by MCL 600.4337, the court may issue a warrant in lieu of habeas corpus.

(3) Duplicate original writs may be issued.

(E) Certification of Record. When proceedings in another court or agency are pertinent to a determination of the issue raised in a habeas corpus action, the court may order the transcript of the record and proceedings certified to the court within a specified time. The order must identify the records to be certified with sufficient specificity to allow them to be located.

(F) Issuance Without Application or Before Filing.

(1) A judge of a court of record, except the probate court, may issue a writ of habeas corpus or order to show cause if

(a) the judge learns that a person within the judge's jurisdiction is illegally restrained, or

(b) an application is presented to the judge before or after normal court hours.

(2) If the prisoner is being held on criminal charges, the writ or order may only be issued by a judge of a court authorized to issue a writ of habeas corpus under subrule (A)(3).

(3) If a complaint is presented to a judge under the provisions of subrule (F)(1)(b), it need not be filed with the court before the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The complaint must subsequently be filed with the court whether or not the writ is granted.

(G) Endorsement of Allowance of Writ. Every writ issued must be endorsed with a certificate of its allowance and the date of the allowance. The endorsement must be signed by the judge issuing the writ, or, if the writ is issued by a panel of more than 1 judge, by a judge of the court.

(H) Form of Writ. A writ of habeas corpus must be substantially in the form approved by the state court administrator.

(I) Service of Writ.

(1) Person to be Served. The writ or order to show cause must be served on the defendant in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.105. If the defendant cannot be found, or if the defendant does not have the prisoner in custody, the writ or order to show cause may be served on anyone having the prisoner in custody or that person's superior, in the manner and with the same effect as if that person had been made a defendant in the action.

(2) Tender of Fees. If the Attorney General or a prosecuting attorney brings the action, or if a judge issues the writ on his or her own initiative, there is no fee. In other actions, to make the service of a writ of habeas corpus effective, the person making service must give the fee provided by law or this rule to the person having custody of the prisoner or to that person's superior.

(a) If the prisoner is in the custody of a sheriff, coroner, constable, or marshal, the fee is that allowed by law to a sheriff for bringing up a prisoner.

(b) If the prisoner is in the custody of another person, the fee is that, if any, allowed by the court issuing the writ, not exceeding the fee allowed by law to a sheriff for similar services.

(J) Sufficiency of Writ. The writ or order to show cause may not be disobeyed because of a defect in form. The writ or order to show cause is sufficient if the prisoner is designated by name, if known, or by a description sufficient to permit identification. The writ or order may designate the person to whom it is directed as the person having custody of the prisoner. Anyone served with the writ or order is deemed the person to whom it is directed and is considered a defendant in the action.

(K) Time for Answer and Hearing.

(1) If the writ is to be answered and the hearing held on a specified day and hour, the answer must be made and the prisoner produced at the time and place specified in the writ.

(2) If an order to show cause is issued, it must be answered as provided in subrule (N), and the hearing must be held at the time and place specified in the order.

(L) Notice of Hearing Before Discharge.

(1) When the answer states that the prisoner is in custody on process under which another person has an interest in continuing the custody, an order of discharge may not be issued unless the interested person or that person's attorney has had at least 4 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing.

(2) When the answer states that the prisoner is detained on a criminal charge, the prisoner may not be discharged until sufficient notice of the time and place of the hearing is given to the prosecuting attorney of the county within which the prisoner is detained or, if there is no prosecuting attorney within the county, to the Attorney General.

(M) Habeas Corpus to Obtain Custody of Child.

(1) A complaint seeking a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into a child's custody must be presented to the judicial circuit for the county in which the child resides or is found.

(2) An order to show cause, not a writ of habeas corpus, must be issued initially if the action is brought by a parent, foster parent, or other relative of the child, to obtain custody of a child under the age of 16 years from a parent, foster parent, or other relative of the child. The court may direct the friend of the court to investigate the circumstances of the child's custody.

(N) Answer.

(1) Contents of Answer; Contempt. The defendant or person served must obey the writ or order to show cause or show good cause for not doing so, and must answer the writ or order to show cause within the time allowed. Failure to file an answer is contempt. The answer must state plainly and unequivocally

(a) whether the defendant then has, or at any time has had, the prisoner under his or her control and, if so, the reason; and

(b) if the prisoner has been transferred, to whom, when the transfer was made, and the reason or authority for the transfer.

(2) Attachments. If the prisoner is detained because of a writ, warrant, or other written authority, a copy must be attached to the answer, and the original must be produced at the hearing. If an order under subrule (E) requires it, the answer must be accompanied by the certified transcript of the record and proceedings.

(3) Verification. The answer must be signed by the person answering, and, except when the person is a sworn public officer and answers in his or her official capacity, it must be verified by oath.

(O) Answer May Be Controverted. In a reply or at a hearing, the plaintiff or the prisoner may controvert the answer under oath, to show either that the restraint is unlawful or that the prisoner is entitled to discharge.

(P) Prisoner; When Bailed. Because a habeas corpus action must be decided promptly with no more than the brief delay provided by subrule (Q)(2), release of a prisoner on bail will not normally be considered until after determination that legal cause exists for the detention. Thereafter, if the prisoner is entitled to bail, the court issuing the writ or order may set bail.

(Q) Hearing and Judgment.

(1) The court shall proceed promptly to hear the matter in a summary manner and enter judgment.

(2) In response to the writ of habeas corpus or order to show cause, the defendant may request adjournment of the hearing. Adjournment may be granted only for the brief delay necessary to permit the defendant

(a) to prepare a written answer (unless waived by the plaintiff); or

(b) to present to the court or judge issuing the writ or order testimonial or documentary evidence to establish the cause of detention at the time for answer.

(3) In the defendant's presence, the court shall inform the prisoner that he or she has the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.

(4) From the time the prisoner is produced in response to the writ or order until judgment is entered, the judge who issued the writ or order has custody of the prisoner and shall make certain that the prisoner's full constitutional rights are protected.

(5) The hearing on the return to a writ of habeas corpus or an order to show cause must be recorded verbatim, unless a court reporter or recorder is not available. If the hearing is conducted without a verbatim record being made, as soon as possible the judge shall prepare and certify a narrative written report. The original report is part of the official record in the action, and copies must be sent forthwith to the parties or their attorneys.

(6) If the prisoner is restrained because of mental disease, the court shall consider the question of the prisoner's mental condition at the time of the hearing, rather than merely the legality of the original detention.

Rule 3.304 Habeas Corpus to Bring Prisoner to Testify or for Prosecution
(A) Jurisdiction; When Available. A court of record may issue a writ of habeas corpus directing that a prisoner in a jail or prison in Michigan be brought to testify

(1) on the court's own initiative; or

(2) on the ex parte motion of a party in an action before a court or an officer or body authorized to examine witnesses.

A writ of habeas corpus may also be issued to bring a prisoner to court for prosecution. Subrules (C)-(G) apply to such a writ.

(B) Contents of Motion. The motion must be verified by the party and must state

(1) the title and nature of the action in which the testimony of the prisoner is desired; and

(2) that the testimony of the prisoner is relevant and necessary to the party in that proceeding.

(C) Direction to Surrender Custody for Transportation. The writ may direct that the prisoner be placed in the custody of a designated officer for transportation to the place where the hearing or trial is to be held, rather than requiring the custodian to bring the prisoner to that place.

(D) Form of Writ. A writ of habeas corpus to produce a prisoner to testify or for prosecution must be substantially in the form approved by the state court administrator.

(E) Answer and Hearing. If the prisoner is produced or delivered to the custody of a designated officer as ordered, the person served with the writ need not answer the writ, and a hearing on the writ is unnecessary.

(F) Remand. When a prisoner is brought on a writ of habeas corpus to testify or for prosecution, the prisoner must be returned to the original custodian after testifying or prosecution.

(G) Applicability of Other Rules. MCR 3.303(G), (I), (J), and (K)(1) apply to habeas corpus to produce a prisoner to testify or for prosecution.

Rule 3.305 Mandamus
(A) Jurisdiction.

(1) An action for mandamus against a state officer may be brought in the Court of Appeals or the Court of Claims.

(2) All other actions for mandamus must be brought in the circuit court unless a statute or rule requires or allows the action to be brought in another court.

(B) Venue.

(1) The general venue statutes and rules apply to actions for mandamus unless a specific statute or rule contains a special venue provision.

(2) In addition to any other county in which venue is proper, an action for mandamus against a state officer may be brought in Ingham County.

(C) Order to Show Cause. On ex parte motion and a showing of the necessity for immediate action, the court may issue an order to show cause. The motion may be made in the complaint. The court shall indicate in the order when the defendant must answer the order.

(D) Answer. If necessity for immediate action is not shown, and the action is not dismissed, the defendant must answer the complaint as in an ordinary civil action.

(E) Exhibits. A party may attach to the pleadings, as exhibits, certified or authenticated copies of record evidence on which the party relies.

(F) Hearings in Circuit Court. The court may hear the matter or may allow the issues to be tried by a jury.

(G) Writ Contained in Judgment. If the judgment awards a writ of mandamus, the writ may be contained in the judgment in the form of an order, and a separate writ need not be issued or served.

Rule 3.306 Quo Warranto
(A) Jurisdiction.

(1) An action for quo warranto against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a state office, or against a state officer who does or suffers an act that by law works a forfeiture of the office, must be brought in the Court of Appeals.

(2) All other actions for quo warranto must be brought in the circuit court.

(B) Parties.

(1) Actions by Attorney General. An action for quo warranto is to be brought by the Attorney General when the action is against:

(a) a person specified in subrule (A)(1);

(b) a person who usurps, intrudes into, or wrongfully holds or exercises an office in a public corporation created by this state's authority;

(c) an association, or number of persons, acting as a corporation in Michigan without being legally incorporated;

(d) a corporation that is in violation of a provision of the act or acts creating, offering, or renewing the corporation;

(2) Actions by Prosecutor or Citizen. Other actions for quo warranto may be brought by the prosecuting attorney of the proper county, without leave of court, or by a citizen of the county by special leave of the court.

(3) Application to Attorney General.

(a) A person may apply to the Attorney General to have the Attorney General bring an action specified in subrule (B)(1). The Attorney General may require the person to give security to indemnify the state against all costs and expenses of the action. The person making the application, and any other person having the proper interest, may be joined as parties plaintiff.

(b) If, on proper application and offer of security, the Attorney General refuses to bring the action, the person may apply to the appropriate court for leave to bring the action himself or herself.

(C) Person Alleged to be Entitled to Office. If the action is brought against the defendant for usurping an office, the complaint may name the person rightfully entitled to the office, with an allegation of his or her right to it, and that person may be made a party.

(D) Venue. The general venue statutes and rules apply to actions for quo warranto, unless a specific statute or rule contains a special venue provision applicable to an action for quo warranto.

(E) Hearing. The court may hear the matter or may allow the issues to be tried by a jury.

Rule 3.310 Injunctions
(A) Preliminary Injunctions.

(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or these rules, an injunction may not be granted before a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction or on an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.

(2) Before or after the commencement of the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the motion. Even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence received at the hearing for a preliminary injunction that would be admissible at the trial on the merits becomes part of the trial record and need not be repeated at the trial. This provision may not be used to deny the parties any rights they may have to trial by jury.

(3) A motion for a preliminary injunction must be filed and noticed for hearing in compliance with the rules governing other motions unless the court orders otherwise on a showing of good cause.

(4) At the hearing on an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue, the party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of establishing that a preliminary injunction should be issued, whether or not a temporary restraining order has been issued.

(5) If a preliminary injunction is granted, the court shall promptly schedule a pretrial conference. The trial of the action on the merits must be held within 6 months after the injunction is granted, unless good cause is shown or the parties stipulate to a longer period. The court shall issue its decision on the merits within 56 days after the trial is completed.

(B) Temporary Restraining Orders.

(1) A temporary restraining order may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party or the adverse party's attorney only if

(a) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by a verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant from the delay required to effect notice or from the risk that notice will itself precipitate adverse action before an order can be issued;

(b) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to give the notice and the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be required; and

(c) a permanent record or memorandum is made of any nonwritten evidence, argument, or other representations made in support of the application.

(2) A temporary restraining order granted without notice must:

(a) be endorsed with the date and time of issuance;

(b) describe the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice;

(c) except in domestic relations actions, set a date for hearing at the earliest possible time on the motion for a preliminary injunction or order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.

(3) Except in domestic relations actions, a temporary restraining order granted without notice expires by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 14 days, as the court sets unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension must be stated on the record or in a document filed in the action.

(4) A temporary restraining order granted without notice must be filed forthwith in the clerk's office and entered in the court records.

(5) A motion to dissolve a temporary restraining order granted without notice takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character, and may be heard on 24 hours' notice. For good cause shown, the court may order the motion heard on shorter notice. The court may set the time for the hearing at the time the restraining order is granted, without waiting for the filing of a motion to dissolve it, and may order that the hearing on a motion to dissolve a restraining order granted without notice be consolidated with the hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction or an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued. At a hearing on a motion to dissolve a restraining order granted without notice, the burden of justifying continuation of the order is on the applicant for the restraining order whether or not the hearing has been consolidated with a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction or an order to show cause.

(C) Form and Scope of Injunction. An order granting an injunction or restraining order

(1) must set forth the reasons for its issuance;

(2) must be specific in terms;

(3) must describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the acts restrained; and

(4) is binding only on the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and on those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.

(D) Security.

(1) Before granting a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, the court may require the applicant to give security, in the amount the court deems proper, for the payment of costs and damages that may be incurred or suffered by a party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.

(2) Security is not required of the state or of a Michigan county or municipal corporation or its officer or agency acting in an official capacity. As to other parties, if security is not required the order must state the reason.

(3) If the party enjoined deems the security insufficient and has had no prior opportunity to be heard, the party may object to the sufficiency of the surety in the manner provided in MCR 3.604(E). The procedures provided in MCR 3.604(F) apply to the objection.

(4) When a bond is required before the issuance of an injunction or temporary restraining order, the bond must be filed with the clerk before the sealing and delivery of the injunction or restraining order.

(E) Stay of Action. An injunction or temporary restraining order may not be granted in one action to stay proceedings in another action pending in another court if the relief requested could be sought in the other pending action.

(F) Denial of Application. When an application for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order is denied, but an order is not signed, an endorsement of the denial must be made on the complaint or affidavit, and the complaint or affidavit filed.

(G) Later Application After Denial of Injunction.

(1) If a circuit judge has denied an application for an injunction or temporary restraining order, in whole or in part, or has granted it conditionally or on terms, later application for the same purpose and in relation to the same matter may not be made to another circuit judge.

(2) If an order is entered on an application in violation of subrule (G)(1), it is void and must be revoked by the judge who entered it, on due proof of the facts. A person making the later application contrary to this rule is subject to punishment for contempt.

(H) Motion for Injunction in Pending Actions. An injunction may also be granted before or in connection with final judgment on a motion filed after an action is commenced.

(I) Application to Special Actions. This rule applies to a special statutory action for an injunction only to the extent that it does not conflict with special procedures prescribed by the statute or the rules governing the special action.

Subchapter 3.400 Proceedings Involving Real Property
Rule 3.401 Partition
(A) Matters to be Determined by Court. On the hearing of an action or proceeding for partition, the court shall determine

(1) whether the premises can be partitioned without great prejudice to the parties;

(2) the value of the use of the premises and of improvements made to the premises; and

(3) other matters the court considers pertinent.

(B) Partition or Sale in Lieu of Partition. If the court determines that the premises can be partitioned, MCR 3.402 governs further proceedings. If the court determines that the premises cannot be partitioned without undue prejudice to the owners, it may order the premises sold in lieu of partition under MCR 3.403.

(C) Joinder of Lienholders. A creditor having a lien on all or part of the premises, by judgment, mortgage, or otherwise, need not be made a party to the partition proceedings. However, the plaintiff may join every creditor having a specific lien on the undivided interest or estate of a party. If the creditors are made parties, the complaint must state the nature of every lien or encumbrance.

Rule 3.402 Partition Procedure
(A) Determination of Parties' Interests. In ordering partition the court shall determine the rights and interests of the parties in the premises, and describe parts or shares that are to remain undivided for owners whose interests are unknown or not ascertained.

(B) Appointment of Partition Commissioner.

(1) The court shall appoint a disinterested person as partition commissioner to make the partition according to the court's determination of the rights and interests of the parties. If the parties agree, three commissioners may be appointed who shall meet together to perform their duties and act by majority vote.

(2) The partition commissioner must be sworn before an officer authorized to administer oaths to honestly and impartially partition the property as directed by the court. The oath must be filed with the clerk of the court.

(3) If the partition commissioner dies, resigns, or neglects to serve, the court may appoint a replacement.

(C) Proceedings Before Partition Commissioner.

(1) The partition commissioner

(a) may apply to the court for instructions;

(b) must give notice of the meeting to consider the problems of the partition to the parties so that they may be heard if they wish to be; and

(c) may take evidence at the meeting concerning the problems of partition.

(2) The partition commissioner shall divide the premises and allot the respective shares according to the terms in the court's judgment or separate order, and shall designate the several shares and portions by reference to a plat or survey prepared by a land surveyor or engineer licensed by the state.

(3) The partition commissioner must report to the court, specifying the procedures followed, describing the land divided and the shares allotted to each party, and listing the commissioner's charges. The parties shall not be present during the preparation of the report or during the deliberations of a panel of three commissioners. A copy of the report must be sent to each party who has appeared in the action.

(D) Setting Aside, Modification, or Confirmation of Partition Commissioner's Report.

(1) The court may modify or set aside the report and may refer the action to either the same or a newly appointed partition commissioner as often as necessary.

(2) On confirming the report, the court shall enter a judgment binding and conclusive on:

(a) all parties named in the action who

(i) have an interest in the partitioned premises as owners in fee or tenants for years,

(ii) are entitled to the reversion, remainder, or inheritance of the premises after the termination of a particular estate in the premises,

(iii) are or will become entitled to a beneficial interest in the premises, or

(iv) have an interest in an undivided share of the premises as tenants for years, for life, or in dower;

(b) the legal representatives of the parties listed in subrule (D)(2)(a);

(c) all persons interested in the premises who were unknown at the time the action was commenced and were given sufficient notice either by publication or personally; and

(d) all other persons claiming from any of the above parties or persons.

(3) The judgment and partition do not affect persons who have claims as tenants in dower or for life to the entire premises subject to the partition; nor do they preclude a person, except those specified in subrule (D)(2), from claiming title to the premises in question or from controverting the title or interest of the parties among whom the partition was made.

(4) An authenticated copy of the report, the judgment confirming it, and any incorporated surveys may be recorded with the register of deeds of the county in which the land is located. Copies of subdivision plats already of record need not be recorded.

(E) Expenses and Costs. The court may order that the expenses and costs, including attorney fees, be paid by the parties in accordance with their respective rights and equities in the premises. An order requiring a party to pay expenses and costs may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment.

(F) Setting Off of Interests in Special Cases.

(1) The court may by order set off the interest that belonged to a deceased party, without subdivision, to those claiming under that party when it is expedient to do so. Those legally entitled under or through the deceased party must be mentioned by name in the judgment.

(2) If the original parties in interest were fully known, but death, legal proceedings, or other operation of law has caused uncertainty about the identity of the present parties in interest, the interests originally owned by known parties but now owned by unknown persons may be separated as provided in this rule, instead of being left undivided. The division and judgment operate to convey the title to the persons claiming under the known party, according to their legal rights.

(3) If an interest in the premises belongs to known or unknown parties who have not appeared in the action, the court shall order partition of the ascertained interests of the known parties who have appeared in the action. The residue of the premises remains for the parties whose interests have not been ascertained, subject to future division.

Rule 3.403 Sale of Premises and Division of Proceeds as Substitute for Partition
(A) Order of Sale.

(1) If a party has a dower interest or life estate in all or a part of the premises at the time of the order for sale, the court shall determine whether, under all the circumstances and with regard for the interests of all the parties, that interest should be excepted from the sale or be sold with the premises. If the court orders that the sale include that party's interest, the sale conveys that interest.

(2) In the order of sale the court shall designate:

(a) which premises are to be sold;

(b) whether the premises are to be sold in separate parcels or together;

(c) whether there is a minimum price at which the premises may be sold;

(d) the terms of credit to be allowed and the security to be required; and

(e) how much of the proceeds will be invested, as required by this rule, for the benefit of unknown owners, infants, parties outside Michigan, and parties who have dower interests or life estates.

(B) Specific Procedures and Requirements of Sale.

(1) The person appointed by the court to conduct the sale shall give notice of the sale, including the terms. Notice must be given in the same manner as required by MCL 600.6052.

(2) Neither the person conducting the sale nor anyone acting in his or her behalf may directly or indirectly purchase or be interested in the purchase of the premises sold. The conservator of a minor or legally incapacitated individual may not purchase or be interested in the purchase of lands that are the subject of the proceedings, except for the benefit of the ward. Sales made contrary to this provision are voidable, except as provided by MCL 700.5421.

(3) The part of the price for which credit is allowed must be secured at interest by a mortgage of the premises sold, a note of the purchaser, and other security the court prescribes.

(a) The person conducting the sale may take separate mortgages and other securities in the name of the clerk of the court and the clerk's successors for the shares of the purchase money the court directs to be invested, and in the name of a known owner, 18 years of age or older, who desires to have his or her share so invested.

(b) When the sale is confirmed, the person conducting the sale must deliver the mortgages and other securities to the clerk of the court, or to the known owners whose shares are invested.

(4) After completing the sale, the person conducting the sale shall file a report with the court, stating

(a) the name of each purchaser,

(b) a description of the parcels of land sold to each purchaser, and

(c) the price paid for each parcel.

A copy of the report must be sent to each party who has appeared in the action.

(5) If the court confirms the sale, it shall enter an order authorizing and directing the person conducting the sale to execute conveyances pursuant to the sale.

(6) Conveyances executed according to these rules shall be recorded in the county where the land is located. These conveyances are a bar against

(a) all interested persons who were made parties to the proceedings;

(b) all unknown parties who were ordered to appear and answer by proper publication or personal service of notice;

(c) all persons claiming through parties listed in subrules (B)(6)(a) and (b);

(d) all persons who have specific liens on an undivided share or interest in the premises, if they were made parties to the proceedings.

(7) If the court confirms the sale, and the successful bidder fails to purchase under the terms of the sale, the court may order that the premises be resold at that bidder's risk. That bidder is liable to pay the amount of his or her bid minus the amount received on resale.

(C) Costs and Expenses of the Proceeding. The person conducting the sale shall deduct the costs and expenses of the proceeding, including the plaintiff's reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court, from the proceeds of the sale and pay them to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney.

(D) Distribution of Proceeds of Sale.

(1) When premises that include a dower interest or life estate are sold, the owner of the dower interest or life estate shall be compensated as provided in this subrule.

(a) Unless the owner consents to the alternative compensation provided in subrule (D)(1)(b), the court shall order that the following amount be invested in interest-bearing accounts insured by an agency of the United States government, with the interest paid annually for life to the owner of the dower interest or life estate:

(i) in the case of a dower interest, one-third of the proceeds of the sale of the premises or of the undivided share of the premises on which the claim of dower existed, after deduction of the owner's share of the expenses of the proceeding;

(ii) in the case of a life estate, the entire proceeds of the sale of the premises, or undivided share of the premises in which the life estate existed, after deduction of the proportion of the owner's share of the expenses of the proceeding.

If the owner of the dower interest or life estate is unknown, the court shall order the protection of the person's rights in the same manner, as far as possible, as if he or she were known and had appeared.

(b) If, before the person conducting the sale files the report of sale, the owner of the dower interest or life estate consents, the court shall direct that the owner be paid an amount that, on the principles of law applicable to annuities, is reasonable compensation for the interest or estate. To be effective the consent must be by a written instrument witnessed and acknowledged in the manner required to make a deed eligible for recording.

(2) If there are encumbrances on the estate or interest in the premises of a party to the proceeding, the person conducting the sale must pay to the clerk the portion of the proceeds attributable to the sale of that estate or interest, after deducting the share of the costs, charges, and expenses for which it is liable. The party who owned that estate or interest may apply to the court for payment of his or her claim out of these proceeds. The application must be accompanied by

(a) an affidavit stating the amount due on each encumbrance and the name and address of the owner of each encumbrance, as far as known; and

(b) proof by affidavit that notice was served on each owner of an encumbrance, in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107.

The court shall hear the proofs, determine the rights of the parties, and direct who must pay the costs of the trial.

After ascertaining the amount of existing encumbrances, the court shall order the distribution of the money held by the clerk among the creditors having encumbrances, according to their priority. When paying an encumbrance the clerk must procure satisfaction of the encumbrance, acknowledged in the form required by law, and must record the satisfaction of the encumbrance. The clerk may pay the expenses of these services out of the portion of the money in court that belongs to the party by whom the encumbrance was payable.

The proceedings under this subrule to ascertain and settle the amounts of encumbrances do not affect other parties to the proceedings for partition and do not delay the payment to a party whose estate in the premises is not subject to an encumbrance or the investing of the money for the benefit of such a person.

(3) The proceeds of a sale, after deducting the costs, must be divided among the parties whose rights and interests have been sold, in proportion to their respective rights in the premises.

(a) The shares of the parties who are 18 years of age or older must be paid to them or to their legal representatives (or brought into court for their use) by the person conducting the sale.

(b) The court may direct that the share of a minor or a legally incapacitated individual be paid to his or her conservator or be invested in interest-bearing accounts insured by an agency of the United States government in the name and for the benefit of the minor or legally incapacitated individual.

(c) If a party whose interest has been sold is absent from the state and has no legal representative in the state or is not known or named in the proceedings, the court shall direct that his or her share be invested in interest-bearing accounts insured by the United States government for the party's benefit until claimed.

(4) The court may require that before receiving a share of the proceeds of a sale a party give a note to secure refund of the share, with interest, if the party is later found not entitled to it.

(5) When the court directs that security be given or investments be made, or the person conducting the sale takes security on the sale of real estate, the bonds, notes, and investments must be taken in the name of the clerk of the court and the clerk's successors in office, unless provision is made to take them in the name of a known owner.

The clerk must hold them and deliver them to his or her successor, and must receive the interest and principal as they become due and apply or reinvest them, as the court directs. The clerk shall annually give to the court a written, sworn account of the money received and the disposition of it.

A security, bond, note, mortgage, or other evidence of the investment may not be discharged, transferred, or impaired by an act of the clerk without the order of the court. A person interested in an investment, with the leave of the court, may prosecute it in the name of the existing clerk, and an action is not abated by the death, removal from office, or resignation of the clerk to whom the instruments were executed or the clerk's successors.

Rule 3.410 Foreclosure of Mortgages and Land Contracts
(A) Rules Applicable. Except as prescribed in this rule, the general rules of procedure apply to actions to foreclose mortgages and land contracts.

(B) Pleading.

(1) A plaintiff seeking foreclosure or satisfaction of a mortgage on real estate or a land contract must state in the complaint whether an action has ever been brought to recover all or part of the debt secured by the mortgage or land contract and whether part of the debt has been collected or paid.

(2) In a complaint for foreclosure or satisfaction of a mortgage or a land contract, it is not necessary to set out in detail the rights and interests of the defendants who are purchasers of, or who have liens on, the premises, subsequent to the recording of the mortgage or land contract. It is sufficient for the plaintiff, after setting out his or her own interest in the premises, to state generally that the defendants have or claim some interest in the premises as subsequent purchasers, encumbrancers, or otherwise.

(C) Time for Sale. A sale under a judgment of foreclosure may not be ordered on less than 42 days' notice. Publication may not begin until the time set by the judgment for payment has expired, and

(1) until 6 months after an action to foreclose a mortgage is begun;

(2) until 3 months after an action to foreclose a land contract is begun.

(D) Disposition of Surplus. When there is money remaining from a foreclosure sale after paying the amount due the plaintiff, a party to the action may move for the disposition of the surplus in accordance with the rights of the parties entitled to it.

(E) Administration of Mortgage Trusts in Equity.

(1) Proceedings of the kind described in MCL 600.3170 are governed by the procedures prescribed by MCL 451.401-451.405, except as modified by this subrule.

(2) A bond, other obligation, or beneficial interest held by or for the benefit of the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successor in estate, or subject to an agreement or option by which the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successor in estate may acquire it or an interest in it, may not be considered in determining a majority of such obligations or beneficial interests, either as part of the majority or as part of the whole number of which the majority is required.

Rule 3.411 Civil Action to Determine Interests in Land
(A) This rule applies to actions to determine interests in land under MCL 600.2932. It does not apply to summary proceedings to recover possession of premises under MCL 600.5701-600.5759.

(B) Complaint.

(1) The complaint must describe the land in question with reasonable certainty by stating

(a) the section, township, and range of the premises;

(b) the number of the block and lot of the premises; or

(c) another description of the premises sufficiently clear so that the premises may be identified.

(2) The complaint must allege

(a) the interest the plaintiff claims in the premises;

(b) the interest the defendant claims in the premises; and

(c) the facts establishing the superiority of the plaintiff's claim.

(C) Written Evidence of Title to be Referred to in Pleadings.

(1) Written evidence of title may not be introduced at trial unless it has been sufficiently referred to in the pleadings in accordance with this rule.

(2) The plaintiff must attach to the complaint, and the defendant must attach to the answer, a statement of the title on which the pleader relies, showing from whom the title was obtained and the page and book where it appears of record.

(3) Within a reasonable time after demand for it, a party must furnish to the adverse party a copy of an unrecorded conveyance on which he or she relies or give a satisfactory reason for not doing so.

(4) References to title may be amended or made more specific in accordance with the general rules regarding amendments and motions for more definite statement.

(D) Findings As to Rights in and Title to Premises.

(1) After evidence has been taken, the court shall make findings determining the disputed rights in and title to the premises.

(2) If a party not in possession of the premises is found to have had a right to possession at the time the action was commenced, but that right expired before the trial, that party must prove the damages sustained because the premises were wrongfully withheld, and the court shall enter judgment in the amount proved.

(E) Claim for Reasonable Value of Use of Premises.

(1) Within 28 days after the finding of title, the party found to have title to the premises may file a claim against the party who withheld possession of the premises for the reasonable value of the use of the premises during the period the premises were withheld, beginning 6 years before the action was commenced.

(2) The court shall hear evidence and make findings, determining the value of the use of the premises.

(a) The findings must be based on the value of the use of the premises in their condition at the time the withholding party, or those through whom that party claims, first went into possession. The use of the buildings or improvements put on the land by the party who withheld possession may not be considered.

(b) The findings must be based on the general value of the use of the premises, not on a peculiar value the use of the premises had to the party who withheld possession or might have had to the party who had title.

(F) Claim for Value of Buildings Erected and Improvements Made on Premises.

(1) Within 28 days after the finding of title, a party may file a claim against the party found to have title to the premises for the amount that the present value of the premises has been increased by the erection of buildings or the making of improvements by the party making the claim or those through whom he or she claims.

(2) The court shall hear evidence as to the value of the buildings erected and the improvements made on the premises, and the value the premises would have if they had not been improved or built upon. The court shall determine the amount the premises would be worth at the time of the claim had the premises not been improved, and the amount the value of the premises was increased at the time of the claim by the buildings erected and improvements made.

(3) The party claiming the value of the improvements may not recover their value if they were made in bad faith.

(G) Election by Party in Title.

(1) The person found to have title to the premises may elect to abandon them to the party claiming the value of the improvements and to take a judgment against that party for the value the premises would have had at the time of the trial if they had not been improved. The election must be filed with the court within 28 days after the findings on the claim for improvements. The judgment for the value of the premises is a lien against the premises.

(2) If the person found to have title does not elect to abandon the premises under subrule (G)(1), the judgment will provide that he or she recover the premises and pay the value of the improvements to the clerk of the court within the time set in the judgment.

(a) The person found to have title must pay the amount, plus accrued interest, before taking possession of the premises under the judgment, if that person is not already in possession.

(b) If the person found to have title fails to pay the amount of the judgment and the accrued interest within the time set in the judgment, he or she is deemed to have abandoned all claim of title to the premises to the parties in whose favor the judgment for the value of the improvements runs.

(H) Judgment Binding Only on Parties to Action. Except for title acquired by adverse possession, the judgment determining a claim to title, equitable title, right to possession, or other interests in lands under this rule, determines only the rights and interests of the known and unknown persons who are parties to the action, and of persons claiming through those parties by title accruing after the commencement of the action.

(I) Possession Under Judgment Not to be Affected by Vacation of Judgment Alone. When the judgment in an action under these rules determines that a party is entitled to possession of the premises in dispute, that party's right to possession is not affected by vacation of the judgment and the granting of a new trial, until a contrary judgment is rendered as a result of the new trial.

Rule 3.412 Construction Liens
In an action to enforce a lien under MCL 570.1101 et seq., or other similar law, if the plaintiff has joined others holding liens or others have filed notice of intention to claim liens against the same property, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to answer the counterclaim or cross-claim of another lien claimant, nor for the other lien claimants to answer the plaintiff's complaint or the cross-claim of another lien claimant, unless one of them disputes the validity or amount of the lien sought to be enforced. If no issue has been raised between lien claimants as to the validity or amount of a lien, the action is ready for hearing when at issue between the lien claimants and the owners, part owners, or lessees of the property.

Subchapter 3.500 Representative Actions
Rule 3.501 Class Actions
(A) Nature of Class Action.

(1) One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members in a class action only if:

(a) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;

(b) there are questions of law or fact common to the members of the class that predominate over questions affecting only individual members;

(c) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;

(d) the representative parties will fairly and adequately assert and protect the interests of the class; and

(e) the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice.

(2) In determining whether the maintenance of the action as a class action will be superior to other available methods of adjudication in promoting the convenient administration of justice, the court shall consider among other matters the following factors:

(a) whether the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of

(i) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that would confront the party opposing the class with incompatible standards of conduct; or

(ii) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class that would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;

(b) whether final equitable or declaratory relief might be appropriate with respect to the class;

(c) whether the action will be manageable as a class action;

(d) whether in view of the complexity of the issues or the expense of litigation the separate claims of individual class members are insufficient in amount to support separate actions;

(e) whether it is probable that the amount which may be recovered by individual class members will be large enough in relation to the expense and effort of administering the action to justify a class action; and

(f) whether members of the class have a significant interest in controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions.

(3) Class members shall have the right to be excluded from the action in the manner provided in this rule, subject to the authority of the court to order them made parties to the action pursuant to other applicable court rules.

(4) Class members have the right to intervene in the action, subject to the authority of the court to regulate the orderly course of the action.

(5) An action for a penalty or minimum amount of recovery without regard to actual damages imposed or authorized by statute may not be maintained as a class action unless the statute specifically authorizes its recovery in a class action.

(B) Procedure for Certification of Class Action.

(1) Motion.

(a) Within 91 days after the filing of a complaint that includes class action allegations, the plaintiff must move for certification that the action may be maintained as a class action.

(b) The time for filing the motion may be extended by order on stipulation of the parties or on motion for cause shown.

(2) Effect of Failure to File Motion. If the plaintiff fails to file a certification motion within the time allowed by subrule (B)(1), the defendant may file a notice of the failure. On the filing of such a notice, the class action allegations are deemed stricken, and the action continues by or against the named parties alone. The class action allegations may be reinstated only if the plaintiff shows that the failure was due to excusable neglect.

(3) Action by Court.

(a) Except on motion for good cause, the court shall not proceed with consideration of the motion to certify until service of the summons and complaint on all named defendants or until the expiration of any unserved summons under MCR 2.102(D).

(b) The court may allow the action to be maintained as a class action, may deny the motion, or may order that a ruling be postponed pending discovery or other preliminary procedures.

(c) In an order certifying a class action, the court shall set forth a description of the class.

(d) When appropriate the court may order that

(i) the action be maintained as a class action limited to particular issues or forms of relief, or

(ii) a proposed class be divided into separate classes with each treated as a class for purposes of certifying, denying certification, or revoking a certification.

(e) If certification is denied or revoked, the action shall continue by or against the named parties alone.

(C) Notice to Class Members.

(1) Notice Requirement. Notice shall be given as provided in this subrule to persons who are included in a class action by certification or amendment of a prior certification, and to persons who were included in a class action by a prior certification but who are to be excluded from the class by amendment or revocation of the certification.

(2) Proposals Regarding Notice. The plaintiff shall include in the motion for certification a proposal regarding notice covering the matters that must be determined by the court under subrule (C)(3). In lieu of such a proposal, the plaintiff may state reasons why a determination of these matters cannot then be made and offer a proposal as to when such a determination should be made. Such a proposal must also be included in a motion to revoke or amend certification.

(3) Action by Court. As soon as practicable, the court shall determine how, when, by whom, and to whom the notice shall be given; the content of the notice; and to whom the response to the notice is to be sent. The court may postpone the notice determination until after the parties have had an opportunity for discovery, which the court may limit to matters relevant to the notice determination.

(4) Manner of Giving Notice.

(a) Reasonable notice of the action shall be given to the class in such manner as the court directs.

(b) The court may require individual written notice to all members who can be identified with reasonable effort. In lieu of or in addition to individual notice, the court may require notice to be given through another method reasonably calculated to reach the members of the class. Such methods may include using publication in a newspaper or magazine; broadcasting on television or radio; posting; or distribution through a trade or professional association, union, or public interest group.

(c) In determining the manner of notice, the court shall consider, among other factors,

(i) the extent and nature of the class,

(ii) the relief requested,

(iii) the cost of notifying the members,

(iv) the resources of the plaintiff, and

(v) the possible prejudice to be suffered by members of the class or by others if notice is not received.

(5) Content of Notice. The notice shall include:

(a) a general description of the action, including the relief sought, and the names and addresses of the representative parties;

(b) a statement of the right of a member of the class to be excluded from the action by submitting an election to be excluded, including the manner and time for exercising the election;

(c) a description of possible financial consequences for the class;

(d) a general description of any counterclaim or notice of intent to assert a counterclaim by or against members of the class, including the relief sought;

(e) a statement that the judgment, whether favorable or not, will bind all members of the class who are not excluded from the action;

(f) a statement that any member of the class may intervene in the action;

(g) the address of counsel to whom inquiries may be directed; and

(h) other information the court deems appropriate.

(6) Cost of Notice.

(a) The plaintiff shall bear the expense of the notification required by subrule (C)(1). The court may require the defendant to cooperate in the notice process, but any additional costs incurred by the defendant in doing so shall be paid by the plaintiff.

(b) Upon termination of the action, the court may allow as taxable costs the expenses of notification incurred by the prevailing party.

(c) Subrules (C)(6)(a) and (b) shall not apply when a statute provides for a different allocation of the cost of notice in a particular class of actions.

(7) Additional Notices. In addition to the notice required by subrule (C)(1), during the course of the action the court may require that notice of any other matter be given in such manner as the court directs to some or all of the members of the class.

(D) Judgment.

(1) The judgment shall describe the parties bound.

(2) A judgment entered before certification of a class binds only the named parties.

(3) A motion for judgment (including partial judgment) under MCR 2.116 may be filed and decided before the decision on the question of class certification. A judgment entered before certification in favor of a named party does not preclude that party from representing the class in the action if that is otherwise appropriate.

(4) A complaint that does not include class action allegations may not be amended to include such allegations after the granting of judgment or partial judgment under MCR 2.116.

(5) A judgment entered in an action certified as a class action binds all members of the class who have not submitted an election to be excluded, except as otherwise directed by the court.

(6) Residual Funds.

(a) “Residual Funds” are funds that remain after the payment of approved class member claims, expenses, litigation costs, attorney’s fees, and other court-approved disbursements made to implement the relief granted in the judgment approving a proposed settlement of a class action.

(b) Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the parties to a class action from proposing a settlement, or the court from entering a judgment approving a settlement, that does not create Residual Funds.

(c) Any judgment approving a proposed settlement of a class action certified under this rule that may result in the existence of Residual Funds shall provide for the disbursement of any such Residual Funds upon the stipulation of the parties and subject to the approval of the court. In matters where the claims process has been exhausted and Residual Funds remain, unless the judgment provides otherwise, the Residual Funds shall be disbursed to the Michigan State Bar Foundation to support activities and programs that promote access to the civil justice system for low income residents of Michigan.

(E) Dismissal or Compromise. An action certified as a class action may not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to the class in such manner as the court directs.

(F) Statute of Limitations.

(1) The statute of limitations is tolled as to all persons within the class described in the complaint on the commencement of an action asserting a class action.

(2) The statute of limitations resumes running against class members other than representative parties and intervenors:

(a) on the filing of a notice of the plaintiff's failure to move for class certification under subrule (B)(2);

(b) 28 days after notice has been made under subrule (C)(1) of the entry, amendment, or revocation of an order of certification eliminating the person from the class;

(c) on entry of an order denying certification of the action as a class action;

(d) on submission of an election to be excluded;

(e) on final disposition of the action.

(3) If the circumstance that brought about the resumption of the running of the statute is superseded by a further order of the trial court, by reversal on appeal, or otherwise, the statute of limitations shall be deemed to have been tolled continuously from the commencement of the action.

(G) Discovery. Representative parties and intervenors are subject to discovery in the same manner as parties in other civil actions. Other class members are subject to discovery in the same manner as persons who are not parties, and may be required to submit to discovery procedures applicable to parties to the extent ordered by the court.

(H) Counterclaims.

(1) Right to File Counterclaims. A party to a class action may file counterclaims as in any other action, including counterclaims by or against a class or an individual class member.

(2) Notice of Intent to File Counterclaims. The defendant may file notice of intent to assert counterclaims against absent class members before notice of certification is given under subrule (C)(1), identifying or describing the persons against whom counterclaims may be filed and describing the nature of the counterclaims.

(3) Time to File. A counterclaim against a class member other than a representative party must be filed and served within 56 days after the class member intervenes or submits a claim for distribution of a share of any award recovered in the action, whichever is earlier, or within such further time as the court allows.

(4) Notice to Class Members. If the notice of certification given under subrule (C)(1) did not notify potential class members of the counterclaim, each class member against whom a counterclaim is asserted shall be permitted to elect to be excluded from the action. Notice of this right shall be served with the counterclaim.

(5) Control of Action. The court shall take such steps as are necessary to prevent the pendency of counterclaims from making the action unmanageable as a class action. Such steps include but are not limited to severing counterclaims for separate trial under MCR 2.505(B) or ordering that consideration of the counterclaims be deferred until after determination of the issue of the defendant's liability, at which time the court may hear the counterclaims, remove them to a lower court, change venue, dismiss them without prejudice, or take other appropriate action.

(I) Defendant Classes.

(1) An action that seeks to recover money from individual members of a defendant class may not be maintained as a class action.

(2) A representative of a defendant class, other than a public body or a public officer, may decline to defend the action in a representative capacity unless the court finds that the convenient administration of justice otherwise requires.

Rule 3.502 Secondary Action by Shareholders
(A) Pleading. In an action brought by one or more shareholders in an incorporated or unincorporated association because the association has refused or failed to enforce rights which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall set forth under oath and with particularity the efforts of the plaintiff to secure from the managing directors or trustees the action the plaintiff desires and the reasons for the failure to obtain such action, or the reasons for not making such an effort.

(B) Security. At any stage of an action under this subrule the court may require such security and impose such terms as shall fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class or association in whose behalf the action is brought or defended.

(C) Notice. The court may order that notice be given, in the manner and to the persons it directs,

(1) of the right of absent persons to appear and present claims and defenses;

(2) of the pendency of the action;

(3) of a proposed settlement;

(4) of entry of judgment; or

(5) of any other proceedings in the action.

(D) Inadequate Representation. Whenever the representation appears to the court inadequate to protect the interests of absent persons who may be bound by the judgment, the court may at any time prior to judgment order an amendment of the pleadings to eliminate references to representation of absent persons, and the court shall enter judgment in such form as to affect only the parties to the action and those adequately represented.

Rule 3.503 Action by Fiduciary
(A) Court Order. When a proceeding is instituted by a fiduciary seeking instruction or authorization with respect to fiduciary duties or the trust property, and it appears that it is impracticable to bring all of the beneficiaries before the court, the court shall enter an order:

(1) setting forth the form of and manner for giving notice of the proceedings to the beneficiaries, and

(2) selecting representatives of the beneficiaries to act as representatives of the class.

(B) Notice. The contents of the notice shall fairly state the purpose of the proceedings and shall specify the time and place of hearing. Where an applicable statute provides for notice, the court may dispense with other notice.

Subchapter 3.600 Miscellaneous Proceedings
Rule 3.601 Public Nuisances
(A) Procedure to Abate Public Nuisance. Actions to abate public nuisances are governed by the general rules of procedure and evidence applicable to nonjury actions, except as provided by the statutes covering public nuisances and by this rule.

(B) Default; Hearing; Notice and Time. If a defendant fails to answer within the time provided, his or her default may be taken. On answer of a defendant or entry of a defendant's default, a party other than a defendant in default may notice the action for hearing on 7 days' notice. Hearings in actions under this rule take precedence over actions that are not entitled to priority by statute or rule and may be held at the time they are noticed without further pretrial proceedings.

(C) Motions; Hearing. Motions by the defendant filed and served with the answer are heard on the day of the hearing of the action.

(D) Entry of Order or Judgment; Preliminary Injunction.

(1) On the day noticed for hearing, the court shall hear and determine the disputed issues and enter a proper order and judgment.

(2) If the hearing is adjourned at the defendant's request, and the court is satisfied by affidavit or otherwise that the allegations in the complaint are true and that the plaintiff is entitled to relief, an injunction as requested may be granted, to be binding until further order.

(3) If service is not obtained on all of the defendants named in the complaint, the court has jurisdiction to hear the action and enter a proper order of abatement and judgment against those defendants who have been served. The order and judgment may not adversely affect the interests of the defendants who have not been served.

(E) Temporary Restraining Order. If a preliminary injunction is requested in the complaint and the court is satisfied by affidavit or otherwise that the material allegations are true, and that the plaintiff is entitled to relief, it may issue a temporary restraining order in accordance with MCR 3.310(B), restraining the defendant from conducting, maintaining, and permitting the continuance of the nuisance and from removing or permitting the removal of the liquor, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, or other things used in the maintenance of the nuisance, until the final hearing and determination on the complaint or further order.

(F) Substitution for Complaining Party. The court may substitute the Attorney General or prosecuting attorney for the complaining party and direct the substituted officer to prosecute the action to judgment.

(G) Further Orders of Court. The court may enter other orders consistent with equity and not inconsistent with the provisions of the statute and this rule.

Rule 3.602 Arbitration
(A) Applicability of Rule. Courts shall have all powers described in MCL 691.1681 et seq., or reasonably related thereto, for arbitrations governed by that statute. The remainder of this rule applies to all other forms of arbitration, in the absence of contradictory provisions in the arbitration agreement or limitations imposed by statute, including MCL 691.1683(2).

(B) Proceedings Regarding Arbitration.

(1) A request for an order to compel or to stay arbitration or for another order under this rule must be by motion, which shall be heard in the manner and on the notice provided by these rules for motions. If there is not a pending action between the parties, the party seeking the requested relief must first file a complaint as in other civil actions.

(2) On motion of a party showing an agreement to arbitrate and the opposing party's refusal to arbitrate, the court may order the parties to proceed with arbitration and to take other steps necessary to carry out the arbitration agreement. If the opposing party denies the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, the court shall summarily determine the issues and may order arbitration or deny the motion.

(3) On motion, the court may stay an arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened on a showing that there is no agreement to arbitrate. If there is a substantial and good-faith dispute, the court shall summarily try the issue and may enter a stay or direct the parties to proceed to arbitration.

(4) A motion to compel arbitration may not be denied on the ground that the claim sought to be arbitrated lacks merit or is not filed in good faith, or because fault or grounds for the claim have not been shown.

(C) Action Involving Issues Subject to Arbitration; Stay. Subject to MCR 3.310(E), an action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration must be stayed if an order for arbitration or motion for such an order has been made under this rule. If the issue subject to arbitration is severable, the stay may be limited to that issue. If a motion for an order compelling arbitration is made in the action or proceeding in which the issue is raised, an order for arbitration must include a stay.

(D) Hearing; Time; Place; Adjournment.

(1) The arbitrator shall set the time and place for the hearing, and may adjourn it as necessary.

(2) On a party's request for good cause, the arbitrator may postpone the hearing to a time not later than the day set for rendering the award.

(E) Oath of Arbitrator and Witnesses.

(1) Before hearing testimony, the arbitrator must be sworn to hear and fairly consider the matters submitted and to make a just award according to his or her best understanding.

(2) The arbitrator has the power to administer oaths to the witnesses.

(F) Discovery and Subpoenas.

(1) The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for the attendance of a witness in this state and for the production of records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with an arbitration proceeding in another state on conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost effective.

(2) A subpoena or discovery-related order issued by an arbitrator in another state shall be served in the manner provided by law for service of subpoenas in a civil action in this state and, on motion to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner provided by law for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action in this state.

(3) On a party's request, the arbitrator may permit the taking of a deposition, for use as evidence, of a witness who cannot be subpoenaed or is unable to attend the hearing. The arbitrator may designate the manner of and the terms for taking the deposition.

(G) Representation by Attorney. A party has the right to be represented by an attorney at a proceeding or hearing under this rule. A waiver of the right before the proceeding or hearing is ineffective.

(H) Award by Majority; Absence of Arbitrator. If the arbitration is by a panel of arbitrators, the hearing shall be conducted by all of them, but a majority may decide any question and render a final award unless the concurrence of all of the arbitrators is expressly required by the agreement to submit to arbitration. If, during the course of the hearing, an arbitrator ceases to act for any reason, the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators may continue with the hearing and determine the controversy.

(I) Award; Confirmation by Court. A party may move for confirmation of an arbitration award within one year after the award was rendered. The court may confirm the award, unless it is vacated, corrected, or modified, or a decision is postponed, as provided in this rule.

(J) Vacating Award.

(1) A request for an order to vacate an arbitration award under this rule must be made by motion. If there is not a pending action between the parties, the party seeking the requested relief must first file a complaint as in other civil actions. A complaint or motion to vacate an arbitration award must be filed no later than 21 days after the date of the arbitration award.

(2) On motion of a party, the court shall vacate an award if:

(a) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;

(b) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption of an arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing a party’s rights;

(c) the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers; or

(d) the arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing on a showing of sufficient cause, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the hearing to prejudice substantially a party’s rights.

The fact that the relief could not or would not be granted by a court of law or equity is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.

(3) A motion to vacate an award must be filed within 91 days after the date of the award. However, if the motion is predicated on corruption, fraud, or other undue means, it must be filed within 21 days after the grounds are known or should have been known. A motion to vacate an award in a domestic relations case must be filed within 21 days after the date of the award.

(4) In vacating the award, the court may order a rehearing before a new arbitrator chosen as provided in the agreement, or, if there is no such provision, by the court. If the award is vacated on grounds stated in subrule (J)(2)(c) or (d), the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrator who made the award. The time within which the agreement requires the award to be made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from the date of the order.

(5) If the motion to vacate is denied and there is no motion to modify or correct the award pending, the court shall confirm the award.

(K) Modification or Correction of Award.

(1)   A request for an order to modify or correct an arbitration award under this rule must be made by motion. If there is not a pending action between the parties, the party seeking the requested relief must first file a complaint as in other civil actions. A complaint to correct or modify an arbitration award must be filed no later than 21 days after the date of the arbitration award.

(2) On motion made within 91 days after the date of the award, the court shall modify or correct the award if:

(a) there is an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of a person, a thing, or property referred to in the award;

(b) the arbitrator has awarded on a matter not submitted to the arbitrator, and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision on the issues submitted; or

(c) the award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.

(3) If the motion is granted, the court shall modify and correct the award to effect its intent and shall confirm the award as modified and corrected. Otherwise, the court shall confirm the award as made.

(4) A motion to modify or correct an award may be joined in the alternative with a motion to vacate the award.

(L) Judgment. The court shall render judgment giving effect to the award as corrected, confirmed, or modified. The judgment has the same force and effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, as other judgments.

(M) Costs. The costs of the proceedings may be taxed as in civil actions, and, if provision for the fees and expenses of the arbitrator has not been made in the award, the court may allow compensation for the arbitrator’s services as it deems just. The arbitrator’s compensation is a taxable cost in the action.

(N) Appeals. Appeals may be taken as from orders or judgments in other civil actions.

Rule 3.603 Interpleader
(A) Availability.

(1) Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not a ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical, but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff denies liability to any or all of the claimants in whole or in part.

(2) A defendant exposed to liability as described in subrule (A)(1), may obtain interpleader by counterclaim or cross-claim. A claimant not already before the court may be joined as defendant, as provided in MCR 2.207 or MCR 2.209.

(3) If one or more actions concerning the subject matter of the interpleader action have already been filed, the interpleader action must be filed in the court where the first action was filed.

(B) Procedure.

(1) The court may order the property or the amount of money as to which the plaintiff admits liability to be deposited with the court or otherwise preserved, or to be secured by a bond in an amount sufficient to assure payment of the liability admitted.

(2) The court may thereafter enjoin the parties before it from commencing or prosecuting another action regarding the subject matter of the interpleader action.

(3) On hearing, the court may order the plaintiff discharged from liability as to property deposited or secured before determining the rights of the claimants.

(C) Rule Not Exclusive. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties permitted by MCR 2.206.

(D) Disposition of Earlier Action. If another action concerning the subject matter of the interpleader action has previously been filed, the court in which the earlier action was filed may:

(1) transfer the action, entirely or in part, to the court in which the interpleader action is pending,

(2) hold the action entirely or partially in abeyance, pending resolution of the interpleader action,

(3) dismiss the action, entirely or in part, or

(4) upon a showing of good cause, proceed with the action, explaining on the record the basis of the decision to proceed.

(E) Actual Costs. The court may award actual costs to an interpleader plaintiff. For the purposes of this rule, actual costs are those costs taxable in any civil action, and a reasonable attorney fee as determined by the trial court.

(1) The court may order that the plaintiff's actual costs of filing the interpleader request, tendering the disputed property to the court, and participating in the case as a disinterested stakeholder be paid from the disputed property or by another party.

(2) If the plaintiff incurs actual costs other than those described in subrule (1) due to another party's unreasonable litigation posture, the court may order that the other party pay those additional actual costs.

(3) An award made pursuant to this rule may not include reimbursement for the actual costs of asserting the plaintiff's own claim to the disputed property, or of supporting or opposing another party's claim.

Rule 3.604 Bonds
(A) Scope of Rule. This rule applies to bonds given under the Michigan Court Rules and the Revised Judicature Act, unless a rule or statute clearly indicates that a different procedure is to be followed.

(B) Submission to Jurisdiction of Court by Surety. A surety on a bond or undertaking given under the Michigan Court Rules or the Revised Judicature Act submits to the jurisdiction of the court and consents that further proceedings affecting the surety's liability on the bond or undertaking may be conducted under this rule.

(C) Death of Party; Substitution of Surety. If the only plaintiff or the only defendant dies during the pendency of an action, in addition to the parties substituted under MCR 2.202, each surety on a bond given by the deceased party shall be made a party to the action, on notice to the surety in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107.

(D) Affidavit of Surety; Notice of Bond.

(1) A surety on a bond, except for a surety company authorized to do business in Michigan, must execute an affidavit that he or she has pecuniary responsibility and attach the affidavit to the bond.

(2) In alleging pecuniary responsibility, a surety must affirm that he or she owns assets not exempt from execution having a fair market value exceeding his or her liabilities by at least twice the amount of the bond.

(3) A copy of a bond and the accompanying affidavit must be promptly served on the party for whose benefit it is given in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107. Proof of service must be filed promptly with the court in which the bond has been filed.

(4) In an action alleging medical malpractice filed on or after October 1, 1986, notice of the filing of security for costs or the affidavit in lieu of such security, required by MCL 600.2912d, 600.2912e, shall be given as provided in MCR 2.109(B).

(E) Objections to Surety. A party for whose benefit a bond is given may, within 7 days after receipt of a copy of the bond, serve on the officer taking the bond and the party giving the bond a notice that the party objects to the sufficiency of the surety. Failure to do so waives all objections to the surety.

(F) Hearing on Objections to Surety. Notice of objection to a surety must be filed as a motion for hearing on objections to the bond.

(1) On demand of the objecting party, the surety must appear at the hearing of the motion and be subject to examination as to the surety's pecuniary responsibility or the validity of the execution of the bond.

(2) After the hearing, the court may approve or reject the bond as filed or require an amended, substitute, or additional bond, as the circumstances warrant.

(3) In an appeal to the circuit court from a lower court or tribunal, an objection to the surety is heard in the circuit court.

If the condition of a bond is broken, or the circumstances require, the court shall direct the delivery or assignment of the bond for prosecution to the person for whose benefit it was given. Proceedings to enforce the bond may be taken in the action pursuant to subrule (I).

(I) Judgment Against Surety.

(1) Judgment on Motion. In an action in which a bond or other security has been posted, judgment may be entered directly against the surety or the security on motion without the necessity of an independent action on a showing that the condition has occurred giving rise to the liability on the bond or to the forfeiture of the security.

(2) Notice. Notice of the hearing on the motion for judgment must be given to the surety or the owner of the security in the manner prescribed in MCR 2.107. The notice may be mailed to the address stated in the bond or stated when the security was furnished unless the surety or owner has given notice of a change of address.

(3) Restitution. If in later proceedings in the action, on appeal or otherwise, it is determined that the surety is not liable or that the security should not have been forfeited, the court may order restitution of money paid or security forfeited.

(J) Application to Another Judge After Supersedeas Refused.

(1) If a circuit judge has denied an application for supersedeas in whole or in part, or has granted it conditionally or on terms, a later application for the same purpose and in the same matter may not be made to another circuit judge if the first judge is available.

(2) If an order is entered contrary to the provisions of subrule (J)(1), it is void and must be revoked by the judge who entered it, on proof of the facts. A person making a later application contrary to this rule is subject to punishment for contempt.

(K) Cash or Securities Bond. The furnishing of a cash or securities bond under MCL 600.2631 is deemed compliance with these rules.

(L) Stay of Proceedings Without Bond. If a party required to give a bond under these rules for supersedeas, appeal, or otherwise is unable to give the bond by reason of poverty, the court may, on proof of the inability, limit or eliminate the requirement for surety on the bond on appropriate conditions and for a reasonable time.

(C) Judgment on Penalty. In an action against a party liable for a penalty, judgment may be rendered directly against the party and in favor of the other party on motion and showing that the condition has occurred giving rise to the penalty. This subrule does not apply to forfeited civil recognizances under MCR 3.604 or to forfeited criminal recognizances under MCL 765.28.

(D) Remission of Penalty. An application for the remission of a penalty, including a bond forfeiture, may be made to the judge who imposed the penalty or ordered the forfeiture. The application may not be heard until reasonable notice has been given to the prosecuting attorney (or municipal attorney) and he or she has had an opportunity to examine the matter and prepare to resist the application. The application may not be granted without payment of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings for the collection of the penalty, unless waived by the court.

(E) Duty of Clerk When Fine Without Order for Commitment; Duty of Prosecutor. When a fine is imposed by a court on a person, without an order for the immediate commitment of the person until the fine is paid, the clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the order imposing the fine to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the court is held, or the municipal attorney in the case of a fine that is payable to a municipality. The prosecuting attorney (or municipal attorney) shall obtain execution to collect the fine.

Rule 3.606 Contempts Outside Immediate Presence of Court
(A) Initiation of Proceeding. For a contempt committed outside the immediate view and presence of the court, on a proper showing on ex parte motion supported by affidavits, the court shall either

(1) order the accused person to show cause, at a reasonable time specified in the order, why that person should not be punished for the alleged misconduct; or

(2) issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the person.

(B) Writ of Habeas Corpus. A writ of habeas corpus to bring up a prisoner to testify may be used to bring before the court a person charged with misconduct under this rule. The court may enter an appropriate order for the disposition of the person.

(3) Return of Bond. On returning a bench warrant, the officer executing it must return the bond of the defendant, if one was taken. The bond must be filed with the bench warrant.

(D) Assignment of Bond; Damages. The court may order assignment of the bond to an aggrieved party who is authorized by the court to prosecute the bond under MCR 3.604(H). The measure of the damages to be assessed in an action on the bond is the extent of the loss or injury sustained by the aggrieved party because of the misconduct for which the order for arrest was issued, and that party's costs and expenses in securing the order. The remainder of the penalty of the bond is paid into the treasury of the county in which the bond was taken, to the credit of the general fund.

(E) Prosecution on Bond by Attorney General or Prosecutor. If the court does not order an assignment as provided in (D), it shall order the breach prosecuted by the Attorney General or by the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the bond was taken, under MCR 3.604. The penalty recovered is to be paid into the treasury of the county in which the bond was taken, to the credit of the general fund.

(F) The court shall not sentence a person to a term of incarceration for nonpayment unless the court has complied with the provisions of MCR 6.425(D)(3).

(B) Manner of Proceeding; Notice to Interested Parties. The party making the application must show to the satisfaction of the court that the record or paper once existed and has been lost, without the fault or connivance, directly or indirectly, of the applicant.

(C) Existing Custody and Parenting Time Orders.

(2) Conditions Modifying Custody and Parenting Time Provisions. If the respondent's custody or parenting time rights will be adversely affected by the personal protection order, the issuing court shall determine whether conditions should be specified in the order which would accommodate the respondent's rights or whether the situation is such that the safety of the petitioner and minor children would be compromised by such conditions.

(3) Effect of Personal Protection Order. A personal protection order takes precedence over any existing custody or parenting time order until the personal protection order has expired, or the court having jurisdiction over the custody or parenting time order modifies the custody or parenting time order to accommodate the conditions of the personal protection order.

(a) If the respondent or petitioner wants the existing custody or parenting time order modified, the respondent or petitioner must file a motion with the court having jurisdiction of the custody or parenting time order and request a hearing. The hearing must be held within 21 days after the motion is filed.

(b) Proceedings to modify custody and parenting time orders are subject to subchapter 3.200.

(b) The respondent may file a motion to modify or terminate an ex parte personal protection order or an ex parte order extending a personal protection order and request a hearing within 14 days after being served with, or receiving actual notice of, the order. Any motion otherwise to modify or terminate a personal protection order by the respondent requires a showing of good cause.

(c) The moving party shall serve the motion to modify or terminate the order and the notice of hearing at least 7 days before the hearing date as provided in MCR 2.105(A)(2) at the mailing address or addresses provided to the court.

The motion must be filed with the court that issued the personal protection order no later than 3 days before the order is to expire. The court must act on the motion within 3 days after it is filed. Failure to timely file a motion to extend the effectiveness of the order does not preclude the petitioner from commencing a new personal protection action regarding the same respondent, as provided in MCR 3.703.

(2) Notice of Extension. If the expiration date on a personal protection order is extended, an amended order must be entered. The clerk must immediately notify the law enforcement agency specified in the personal protection order of the change. The order must be served on the respondent as provided in MCR 2.107.

As long as the respondent is either present in the courtroom or has waived the right to be present, on motion of either party, the court may use telephonic, voice, or videoconferencing technology to take testimony from an expert witness or, upon a showing of good cause, any person at another location.

(E) Pleas of Guilty. The respondent may plead guilty to the violation. Before accepting a guilty plea, the court, speaking directly to the respondent and receiving the respondent's response, must

(1) advise the respondent that by pleading guilty the respondent is giving up the right to a contested hearing and, if the respondent is proceeding without legal representation, the right to a lawyer's assistance as set forth in subrule (D)(3),

(2) advise the respondent of the maximum possible jail sentence for the violation,

(3) ascertain that the plea is understandingly, voluntarily, and knowingly made, and

(1) Set a date for the hearing at the earliest practicable time except as required under MCL 764.15b.

(a) The hearing of a respondent being held in custody for an alleged violation of a personal protection order must be held within 72 hours after the arrest, unless extended by the court on the motion of the arrested individual or the prosecuting attorney. The court must set a reasonable bond pending the hearing unless the court determines that release will not reasonably ensure the safety of the individuals named in the personal protection order.

(b) If a respondent is released on bond pending the hearing, the bond may include any condition specified in MCR 6.106(D) necessary to reasonably ensure the safety of the individuals named in the personal protection order, including continued compliance with the personal protection order. The release order shall also comply with MCL 765.6b.

(c) If the alleged violation is based on a criminal offense that is a basis for a separate criminal prosecution, upon motion of the prosecutor, the court may postpone the hearing for the outcome of that prosecution.

(2) Notify the prosecuting attorney of a criminal contempt proceeding.

(3) Notify the petitioner and his or her attorney, if any, of the contempt proceeding and direct the party to appear at the hearing and give evidence on the charge of contempt.

(G) Prosecution After Arrest. In a criminal contempt proceeding commenced under MCL 764.15b, the prosecuting attorney shall prosecute the proceeding unless the petitioner retains his or her own attorney for the criminal contempt proceeding.

(H) The Violation Hearing.

(1) Jury. There is no right to a jury trial.

(2) Conduct of the Hearing. The respondent has the right to be present at the hearing, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. As long as the respondent is either present in the courtroom or has waived the right to be present, on motion of either party, and with the consent of the parties, the court may use telephonic, voice, or videoconferencing technology to take testimony from an expert witness or, upon a showing of good cause, any person at another location.

(3) Evidence; Burden of Proof. The rules of evidence apply to both criminal and civil contempt proceedings. The petitioner or the prosecuting attorney has the burden of proving the respondent's guilt of criminal contempt beyond a reasonable doubt and the respondent's guilt of civil contempt by clear and convincing evidence.

(4) Judicial Findings. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court must find the facts specially, state separately its conclusions of law, and direct entry of the appropriate judgment. The court must state its findings and conclusions on the record or in a written opinion made a part of the record.

(5) Sentencing.

(a) If the respondent pleads or is found guilty of criminal contempt, the court shall impose a sentence of incarceration for no more than 93 days and may impose a fine of not more than $500.00.

(b) If the respondent pleads or is found guilty of civil contempt, the court shall impose a fine or imprisonment as specified in MCL 600.1715 and 600.1721.

In addition to such a sentence, the court may impose other conditions to the personal protection order.

(I) Mechanics of Use. The use of videoconferencing technology under this rule must be in accordance with the standards established by the State Court Administrative Office. All proceedings at which videoconferencing technology is used must be recorded verbatim by the court.

Rule 3.715 Definitions
When used in MCR 3.716-3.722, unless the context otherwise indicates:

(1) “Complaint.” An individual seeking an extreme risk protection order is petitioning a court for relief. However, the Legislature uses the terms “complaint” and “summons” throughout the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, MCL 691.1801 et seq., rather than the term “petition.” Therefore, for the purposes of MCR 3.716-3.722 only, a complaint means the act of petitioning the court to issue an extreme risk protection order. Petitioning the court in this manner commences an independent action for an extreme risk protection order and is not considered a motion as defined in MCR 2.119.

(2) “Dating relationship” means that term as defined in MCL 691.1803.

(3) “Existing action” means an action in any court in which both the petitioner and the respondent are parties; existing action includes, but is not limited to, pending and completed domestic relations actions, and other actions for personal protection or extreme risk protection orders.

(4) “Extreme risk protection order” means that term as defined in MCL 691.1803.

(5) “Family member,” “guardian,” “health care provider,” “law enforcement agency,” and “law enforcement officer,” mean those terms as defined in MCL 691.1803.

(6) “Minor” means a person under the age of 18.

(7) “Petitioner” means the party seeking an extreme risk protection order.

(8) “Possession or control” means that term as defined in MCL 691.1803.

(9) “Respondent” means the party to be restrained by the extreme risk protection order.

Rule 3.716 Commencing an Extreme Risk Protection Action
(A) Filing.

(1) An extreme risk protection action is an independent action commenced by filing a complaint with the family division of the circuit court. A complaint may be filed regardless of whether the respondent owns or possesses a firearm. A proposed extreme risk protection order must be prepared on a form approved by the State Court Administrative Office and submitted at the same time as the complaint. When completing the proposed order, the petitioner must complete the case caption and the known fields with identifying information, including the race, sex, and date of birth or age of the respondent. The personal identifying information form approved by the State Court Administrative Office does not need to be completed or filed in extreme risk protection actions. There are no fees for filing an extreme risk protection action, and no summons is issued. An extreme risk protection action may not be commenced by filing a motion in an existing case or by joining a claim to an action.

(2) An extreme risk protection action may only be commenced by the following individuals:

(a) the spouse of the respondent;

(b) a former spouse of the respondent;

(c) an individual who:

(i) has a child in common with the respondent,

(ii) has or has had a dating relationship with the respondent, or

(iii) resides or has resided in the same household with the respondent;

(d) a family member;

(e) a guardian of the respondent;

(f) a law enforcement officer; or

(g) a health care provider, if filing and maintaining the action does not violate requirements of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, or regulations promulgated under that act, 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, or physician-patient confidentiality.

(B) Complaint in General. The complaint must

(1) be in writing;

(2) state the respondent’s name and address;

(3) state with particularity any facts that show the issuance of an extreme risk protection order is necessary because the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure themselves or another individual by possessing a firearm, and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that are substantially supportive of the expectation, including facts that address the factors in MCL 691.1807(1) that the court must consider when determining whether to issue an extreme risk protection order;

(4) if known by the petitioner, state whether any following circumstances are applicable:

(a) the respondent is required to carry a pistol as a condition of the respondent’s employment and is issued a license to carry a concealed pistol,

(b) the respondent is any of the following:

(i) a police officer licensed or certified under the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards Act (MCOLES), MCL 28.601 to MCL 28.615,

(ii) a sheriff or deputy sheriff,

(iii) a member of the Department of State Police,

(v) an employee of the Michigan Department of Corrections, or

(vi) a federal law enforcement officer who carries a pistol during the normal course of the officer’s employment or an officer of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,

(5) state whether the petitioner knows or believes that the respondent owns or possesses firearms and, to the extent possible, identify the firearms, giving their location and any additional information that would help a law enforcement officer find the firearms;

(6) state the relief sought;

(7) state whether an ex parte order is being sought and, if so, state with particularity the facts that show the issuance of an ex parte order is necessary because

(a) immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result from the delay required to effectuate notice, or

(b) the notice will itself precipitate adverse action before an order can be issued,

(8) state whether an extreme risk protection action involving the respondent has been commenced in another jurisdiction and, if so, identify the jurisdiction;

and

(9) be signed by the party or attorney as provided in MCR 1.109(E). If the complaint requests an ex parte order, the complaint must also comply with MCR 3.718(A)(2).

(C) The petitioner’s address must not be disclosed in any pleading, paper, or in any other manner. The petitioner must provide the court with an address and contact information, including an email address and telephone number if available, in the form and manner established by the State Court Administrative Office. The clerk of the court must maintain the petitioner’s address as confidential in the court file.

(D) Complaint Against a Minor. In addition to the requirements outlined in subrule (B), a complaint against a minor must also list, if known or can be easily ascertained, the names and addresses of the minor’s parent(s), guardian, or custodian.

(E) Other Pending Actions; Order, Judgments.

(1) The complaint must specify whether there are any other pending actions in this or any other court, or orders or judgments already entered by this or any other court affecting the parties, including the name of the court and the case number, if known.

(a) If the complaint is filed in the same court as a pending action or where an order or judgment has already been entered by that court affecting the parties, it shall be assigned to the same judge.

(b) If there are pending actions in another court or orders or judgments already entered by another court affecting the parties, the court may contact the court where the pending actions were filed or orders or judgments were entered, if practicable, to determine any relevant information.

(2) If the prior action resulted in an order providing for continuing jurisdiction of a minor, and the new action requests relief with regard to the minor, the court must comply with MCR 3.205.

(F) Venue.

(1) If the respondent is an adult, the petitioner may file an extreme risk protection action in any county in Michigan regardless of the parties’ residency or location.

(2) If the respondent is a minor, the petitioner must file an extreme risk protection action in either the petitioner’s or respondent’s county of residence.

(3) If the respondent does not live in Michigan, the petitioner must file an extreme risk protection action in the petitioner’s county of residence.

(G) Minor or Legally Incapacitated Individual as Petitioner or Respondent. If a petitioner or respondent is a minor or a legally incapacitated individual, the court must appoint a next friend or guardian ad litem as provided by MCR 2.201(E).

Rule 3.717 Dismissals
Except as specified in MCR 3.718(A)(5), MCR 3.718(B), MCR 3.718(D), and MCR 3.720, an action for an extreme risk protection order may only be dismissed upon motion by the petitioner prior to the issuance of an order. There is no fee for such a motion. This rule does not preclude a dismissal as otherwise permitted by law.

Rule 3.718 Issuing Extreme Risk Protection Orders
(A) Ex Parte Orders. Except as otherwise provided in this rule:

(1) The court must rule on a request for an ex parte order within one business day of the filing date of the complaint. The court must expedite and give priority to ruling on a request for an ex parte order.

(2) An ex parte order must be granted if it clearly appears from the specific facts shown by a verified, written complaint that

(a) by a preponderance of the evidence after considering the factors identified in MCL 691.1807(1), the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure themselves or another individual by possessing a firearm, and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that substantially support the expectation that the respondent will intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure themselves or another individual by possessing a firearm; and

(b) pursuant to MCL 691.1807(2), there is clear and convincing evidence that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result from the delay required to effectuate notice or that the notice will itself precipitate adverse action before an order can be issued.

(3) An ex parte order expires one year after the date of issuance.

(4) If an ex parte order is entered, the complaint and order must be served as provided in MCR 3.719(B). However, failure to effectuate service does not affect the order’s validity or effectiveness.

(5) If the court refuses to grant an ex parte order, it must immediately state the reasons in writing and advise the petitioner of the right to request a hearing as provided in subrule (D). If the petitioner does not request a hearing within 21 days of entry of the order, the order denying the complaint is final.

(B) Immediate Emergency Ex Parte Orders.

(1) A petitioner who is a law enforcement officer may verbally request by telephone that a judge or magistrate on duty within that jurisdiction immediately issue an emergency ex parte order under subrule (A) if the officer is responding to a complaint involving the respondent and the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure the respondent or another individual by possessing a firearm.

(2) The judge or magistrate must immediately rule on a verbal request made under this subrule, and if the judge or magistrate issues an immediate emergency ex parte order,

(a) the officer must notify the respondent of the order and advise where they can obtain a copy of the order;

(b) within one business day, the officer must file a sworn written complaint detailing the facts and circumstances presented verbally to the judge or magistrate; and

(c) if the officer does not file the complaint within one business day, the court must, unless good cause is shown,

(i) terminate the immediate emergency ex parte order,

(ii) order that the respondent, subject to the restrictions in MCL 691.1815, may reclaim any seized firearm(s), and

(iii) dismiss the case.

(3) In each county, the circuit court must file for approval with the state court administrator a plan to make a judge or magistrate on duty and available each day of the year to immediately review and rule on a verbal request made under this subrule. The court must provide their approved plan to all law enforcement agencies within their jurisdiction.

(C) Anticipatory Search Warrant. If the court orders the firearms immediately surrendered, the law enforcement officer serving the order pursuant to MCR 3.719(B)(2) may file an affidavit requesting that the court issue an anticipatory search warrant authorizing a law enforcement agency to search the location or locations where the firearm(s) or concealed pistol license is believed to be and to seize any firearm(s) or concealed pistol license discovered during the search in compliance with 1966 PA 189, MCL 780.651 to 780.659. The law enforcement officer’s affidavit may include affirmative allegations contained in the complaint. An anticipatory search warrant issued under this subrule is subject to and contingent on the failure or refusal of the respondent, following service of the order, to immediately comply with the order and immediately surrender to a law enforcement officer any firearm or concealed pistol license in the individual’s possession or control. The court must issue the anticipatory search warrant if the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that if the respondent refuses to immediately comply with the order, there is a fair probability that the respondent’s firearm(s) or concealed pistol license will be found in the location or locations to be searched.

(D) Hearing.

(1) The court must expedite and give priority to hearings required by the extreme risk protection act.

(2) The court must schedule a hearing for the issuance of an extreme risk protection order in the following instances:

(a) The complaint does not request an ex parte order. If the petitioner does not request an ex parte order, the hearing must occur within 14 days of the date the complaint is filed.

(b) The court refuses to enter an ex parte order and the petitioner timely requests a hearing. If the court refuses to enter an ex parte order, the hearing must occur within 14 days of the petitioner’s request for a hearing.

(c) The court entered an ex parte order and the respondent requests a hearing.

(3) If the court enters an ex parte order or an immediate emergency ex parte order and the respondent requests a hearing, the hearing must occur

(a) unless subrule (3)(b) applies, within 14 days after the order is served on the respondent or after the respondent receives actual notice of the order. A respondent must request this hearing within 7 days after the order is served or after the respondent receives actual notice of the order.

(b) within 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays if the court is closed to the public, after the order is served on the respondent or after the respondent receives actual notice of the order, if the respondent is an individual described in MCL 691.1805(5). A respondent must request this hearing within 3 days after the order is served or after the respondent receives actual notice of the order. If the court is closed to the public upon the expiration of this 3-day period, the request must be made not later than the next business day. To ensure timely notice, the clerk of the court must notify the petitioner of this hearing at the email address and telephone number provided by the petitioner under MCR 3.716(C).

A respondent waives their right to a hearing on an ex parte order under subrule (D)(2)(c) if the respondent does not request a hearing within the timeframes specified in subrules (D)(3)(a) and (D)(3)(b).

(4) The petitioner must serve on the respondent the complaint and notice of the hearing as provided in MCR 2.105(A), for a hearing scheduled under subrules (D)(2)(a)-(b). If the respondent is a minor, and the whereabouts of the respondent’s parent(s), guardian, or custodian are known, the petitioner must also in the same manner serve the complaint and notice of the hearing on the respondent’s parent(s), guardian, or custodian. The clerk of the court must serve the respondent’s request for a hearing under subrule (D)(2)(c) on the petitioner, as provided in MCR 2.107(C) and subrule (D)(3)(b), due to the confidential nature of the petitioner’s address unless the petitioner electronically filed the case under MCR 1.109(G) and the respondent has registered with the electronic-filing system. In that instance, the respondent must serve the petitioner electronically at the petitioner’s registered email address. If the respondent is a person described in MCL 691.1805(5), providing notice one day before the hearing is deemed as sufficient notice to the petitioner.

(5) The hearing must be held on the record. In accordance with MCR 2.407 and MCR 2.408, the court may allow the use of videoconferencing technology.

(6) The petitioner must attend the hearing and carries the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to, intentionally or unintentionally, seriously physically injure themselves or another individual by possessing a firearm and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that are substantially supportive of the expectation. If the petitioner fails to attend the hearing, the court may adjourn and reschedule the hearing or dismiss the complaint.

(7) If the respondent fails to appear at a hearing on the complaint under subrules (D)(2)(a)-(b) and the court determines the petitioner made diligent attempts to serve the respondent, whether the respondent was served or not, the order may be entered without further notice to the respondent if the court determines an extreme risk protection order is necessary. If the respondent fails to appear at a hearing on the complaint requested under subrule (D)(2)(c), the court may adjourn and reschedule the hearing or continue the order without further hearing.

(8) At the hearing, the court must consider the factors identified in MCL 691.1807(1) and state on the record the reasons for granting, denying, or continuing an extreme risk protection order and enter an appropriate order. Additionally, the court must immediately state the reasons for granting, denying, or continuing an extreme risk protection order in writing.

If the respondent has been issued a license under MCL 28.422 that the respondent has not used and that is not yet void, the respondent must not use it and must surrender it to the law enforcement agency designated under MCL 691.1809(1)(g).

(3) Concealed Carry Licenses. The respondent must not apply for a concealed pistol license.

Unless the petitioner is a law enforcement officer or health care provider, there is a presumption that the respondent will have 24 hours to surrender the firearms.

(5) Firearm Description. If the petitioner has identified any firearms in the complaint, a specific description of the firearms to be surrendered or seized.

(B) Service.

(1) Except as provided in subrule (B)(2), the petitioner must serve the order on the respondent as provided in MCR 2.105(A). If the respondent is a minor, and the whereabouts of the respondent’s parent(s), guardian, or custodian is known, the petitioner must also in the same manner serve the order on the respondent’s parent(s), guardian, or custodian. On an appropriate showing, the court may allow service in another manner as provided in MCR 2.105(J). Failure to serve the order does not affect its validity or effectiveness.

(2) If the court ordered the immediate surrender of the respondent’s firearms, the order must be served personally by a law enforcement officer.

(3) Proof of service must be filed with the court within one business day after service.

(C) Oral Notice. If oral notice of the order is made by a law enforcement officer as described in MCL 691.1813(3), proof of the notification must be filed with the court by the law enforcement officer within one business day after the notification.

(a) File with the court that issued the order one or more documents or other evidence verifying that all of the following are true:

(i) All firearms previously in the respondent’s possession or control were surrendered to or seized by the local law enforcement agency designated under MCL 691.1809(1)(g), or if allowed as ordered by the court, to a licensed firearm dealer on the list prepared under MCL 691.1818.

If the court is closed when the 24-hour period expires, the respondent must complete the required filing not later than the next business day.

(2) Failure to File. The clerk of the court must review the proof of service filed with the court and determine whether the respondent has complied with the filing requirements of subrule (D)(1). If the respondent has not complied with the filing requirements of subrule (D)(1), the clerk and the court must take the following actions:

(a) Clerk of the Court. The clerk of the court must notify the local law enforcement agency identified in MCL 691.1809(1)(g) and the assigned judge of the failure to comply with the filing requirements. If this notice is provided, the clerk of the court must again notify the local law enforcement agency and the assigned judge when the respondent has complied with the filing requirements.

(b) Court. The court must issue either a bench warrant or an order to show cause to initiate contempt proceedings as identified in MCR 3.721. If issuing an order to show cause, the hearing must be scheduled within 5 days of the date the proof of service is filed with the court. The court may recall the bench warrant or cancel the order to show cause if the respondent makes the required filings identified in subrule (D)(1). If the respondent fails to appear for the show cause hearing, the court must issue a bench warrant.

If the court issues a bench warrant under this subrule, a law enforcement officer may file an affidavit requesting that the court issue a search warrant to search the location or locations where the firearm(s) or concealed pistol license is believed to be and to seize any firearm(s) or concealed pistol license discovered during the search. The law enforcement officer’s affidavit may include affirmative allegations contained in the complaint. If the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe the location or locations to be searched are places where the firearm(s) or concealed pistol license is believed to be, the court must issue the search warrant.

(E) Clerk of the Court Responsibilities. The clerk of the court that issues an extreme risk protection order must complete the actions identified in MCL 691.1811.

Rule 3.720 Modification, Termination, or Extension of Order

If the order is extended under subrule (B), the respondent may file one motion to modify or terminate the order during the first six months that the extended order is in effect, and one motion during the second six months that the extended order is in effect. If the respondent files more than one motion during these times, the court must review the motion before a hearing is held and may summarily dismiss the motion without a response from the petitioner and without a hearing.

(2) Service. The nonmoving party must be served, as provided in MCR 2.107 at the mailing address or addresses provided to the court, the motion to modify or terminate the order and the notice of hearing at least 7 days before the hearing date. The petitioner must serve the petitioner’s motion on the respondent. The clerk of the court must serve the respondent’s motion on the petitioner due to the confidential nature of the petitioner’s address unless the petitioner electronically filed the case under MCR 1.109(G) and the respondent has registered with the electronic-filing system. In that instance, the respondent must serve the petitioner electronically at the petitioner’s registered email address.

(3) Hearing on the Motion. The court must schedule and hold a hearing on a motion to modify or terminate an extreme risk protection order within 14 days of the filing of the motion.

(4) Notice of Modification or Termination.

A modified or terminated order must be served on the respondent as provided in MCR 2.107.

(5) If the extreme risk protection order expires or is terminated, the court must order, subject to the restrictions in MCL 691.1815, that the respondent may reclaim any seized firearm(s). Upon the motion of the respondent, the court may also order, at any time, the transfer of the respondent’s firearm(s) seized by law enforcement under the extreme risk protection order to a licensed firearm dealer if the respondent sells or transfers ownership of the firearm to the dealer.

(B) Extension of Order.

The respondent must be served the motion to extend the order and the notice of hearing at least 7 days before the hearing date as provided in MCR 2.107 at the mailing address or addresses provided to the court. The petitioner must serve the petitioner’s motion on the respondent. The clerk of the court must serve both the petitioner and respondent if upon the court’s own motion. Failure to timely file a motion to extend the effectiveness of the order does not preclude the petitioner from commencing a new extreme risk protection action regarding the same respondent, as provided in MCR 3.716.

(b) Legal Standard. The court must only issue the extended order under this subrule if the preponderance of the evidence shows that the respondent can reasonably be expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously physically injure themselves or another individual by possessing a firearm and has engaged in an act or acts or made significant threats that are substantially supportive of the expectation.

(2) Automatic Extensions. If the court or a jury finds that the respondent has refused or failed to comply with an extreme risk protection order, the court that issued the order must issue an extended extreme risk protection order effective for 1 year after the expiration of the preceding order.

(1) Filing. If the respondent violates the extreme risk protection order, the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the order was issued or a law enforcement officer may file a motion, supported by appropriate affidavit, to have the respondent found in contempt. There is no fee for such a motion. If the motion and affidavit establish probable cause for a finding of contempt, the court must either:

(b) issue a bench warrant for the arrest of the respondent.

(2) Service. If issuing an order to show cause, the hearing must be held within 5 days. The prosecuting attorney or law enforcement officer must serve the motion to show cause and the order on the respondent and petitioner as provided in MCR 2.107.

If the violation alleges that the respondent has a firearm or concealed pistol license in the respondent’s possession or control, a law enforcement officer or prosecuting attorney may also file an affidavit requesting that the court issue a search warrant to search the location or locations where the firearm(s) or concealed pistol license is believed to be and to seize any firearm(s) or concealed pistol license discovered during the search. The law enforcement officer’s affidavit may include affirmative allegations contained in the complaint. If the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe the location or locations to be searched are places where the firearm(s) or concealed pistol license is believed to be, the court must issue the search warrant.

(b) of the right to contest the charge at a contempt hearing, and

(c) that they are entitled to a lawyer’s assistance at the hearing and, if the court determines it might sentence the respondent to jail, that the court, or the local funding unit’s appointing authority if the local funding unit has determined that it will provide representation to respondents alleged to have violated an extreme risk protection order, will appoint a lawyer at public expense if the individual wants one and is financially unable to retain one;

(b) of the maximum possible jail sentence for the violation; and

(c) that if they plead guilty to violating the extreme risk protection order, the court will automatically extend the duration of the extreme risk protection order for 1 year after the expiration of the preceding order;

(2) ascertain that the plea is understandingly, voluntarily, and knowingly made; and

(3) establish factual support for a finding that the respondent is guilty of the alleged violation.

(a) The hearing of a respondent being held in custody for an alleged violation of an extreme risk protection order must be held within 72 hours after the arrest, unless extended by the court on the motion of the arrested individual or the prosecuting attorney. The court must set a reasonable bond pending the hearing unless the court determines that release will not reasonably ensure the safety of the respondent or any other individual(s).

(b) If a respondent is released on bond pending the hearing, the bond may include any condition specified in MCR 6.106(D) necessary to reasonably ensure the safety of the respondent and other individuals, including continued compliance with the extreme risk protection order. The release order shall comply with MCL 765.6b.

(c) If the alleged violation is based on a criminal offense that is a basis for a separate criminal prosecution, upon motion of the prosecutor, the court may postpone the hearing for the outcome of that prosecution.

(2) Notify the prosecuting attorney of the contempt proceeding.

(3) Notify the petitioner and the petitioner’s attorney, if any, and the law enforcement officer that filed the motion, if applicable, of the contempt proceeding and direct the party to appear at the hearing and give evidence on the charge of contempt.

(G) Prosecution After Arrest. If the court holds a contempt proceeding, the prosecuting attorney must prosecute the proceeding.

(H) The Violation Hearing.

(1) Jury. There is no right to a jury trial.

(2) Conduct of the Hearing. The respondent has the right to be present at the hearing, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.

(3) Evidence; Burden of Proof. The rules of evidence apply to both criminal and civil contempt proceedings. The prosecuting attorney has the burden of proving the respondent’s guilt of criminal contempt beyond a reasonable doubt and the respondent’s guilt of civil contempt by clear and convincing evidence.

(4) Judicial Findings. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court must find the facts specifically, state separately its conclusion of law, and direct entry of the appropriate judgment. The court must state its findings and conclusion on the record or in a written opinion made a part of the record.

(25 USC 1917.)

Rule 3.808 Finalizing Adoption; Findings of Court

Such a substitute attorney must be familiar with the case and, for hearings other than a preliminary hearing or emergency removal hearing, must review the agency case file and consult with the foster parents and caseworker before the hearing unless the child's lawyer-guardian ad litem has done so and communicated that information to the substitute attorney.

(E)   Retention and Destruction of Court Records.

The court shall destroy its case files and other court records only as prescribed by the records retention and disposal schedule established under MCR 8.119(K). Destruction of a case record does not negate, rescind, or set aside an adjudication.

Rule 3.926 Transfer of Jurisdiction; Change of Venue
(A) Definition. As used in MCL 712A.2, a child is “found within the county” in which the offense against the child occurred, in which the offense committed by the juvenile occurred, or in which the minor is physically present.

(B) Transfer to County of Residence. When a minor is brought before the family division of the circuit court in a county other than that in which the minor resides, the court may request transfer of the case to the court in the county of residence before trial. The court shall not order transfer of the case until the court to which the case is to be transferred has granted the request to accept the transfer.

(1) If both parents reside in the same county, or if the child resides in the county with a parent who has been awarded legal custody, a guardian, a legal custodian, or the child's sole legal parent, that county will be presumed to be the county of residence.

(2) In circumstances other than those enumerated in subsection (1) of this section, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the child's county of residence:

(a) The county of residence of the parent or parents, guardian, or legal custodian.

(b) Whether the child has ever lived in the county, and, if so, for how long.

(c) Whether either parent has moved to another county since the inception of the case.

(d) Whether the child is subject to the prior continuing jurisdiction of another court.

(e) Whether a court has entered an order placing the child in the county for the purpose of adoption.

(f) Whether the child has expressed an intention to reside in the county.

(g) Any other factor the court considers relevant.

(3) If the child has been placed in a county by court order or by placement by a public or private agency, the child shall not be considered a resident of the county in which he or she has been placed, unless the child has been placed for the purpose of adoption.

(C) Costs. When a court other than the court in a county in which the minor resides orders disposition, it will be responsible for any costs incurred in connection with such order unless

(1) the court in the county in which the minor resides agrees to pay the costs of such disposition, or

(2) the minor is made a state ward pursuant to the Youth Rehabilitation Services Act, MCL 803.301 et seq., and the county of residence withholds consent to a transfer of the case.

(D) Change of Venue; Grounds. The court, on motion by a party, may order a case to be heard before a court in another county:

(1) for the convenience of the parties and witnesses, provided that a judge of the other court agrees to hear the case; or

(2) when an impartial trial cannot be had where the case is pending.

All costs of the proceeding in another county are to be borne by the court ordering the change of venue.

(E) Bifurcated Proceeding. If the judge of the transferring court and the judge of the receiving court agree, the case may be bifurcated to permit adjudication in the transferring court and disposition in the receiving court. The case may be returned to the receiving court immediately after the transferring court enters its order of adjudication.

(F) Transfer of Records.

(1) The transferring court must enter all necessary orders pertaining to the certification and transfer of the action to the receiving court. Where the courts have agreed to bifurcate the proceedings, the court adjudicating the case shall send any supplemented pleadings and other records to the court entering the disposition in the case.

(2) The clerk of the court must prepare the case records for transfer in accordance with the orders entered under subrule (1) and the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and send them to the receiving court by a secure method.

(G) Designated Cases. Designated cases are to be filed in the county in which the offense is alleged to have occurred. Other than a change of venue for the purpose of trial, a designated case may not be transferred to any other county, except, after conviction, a designated case may be transferred to the juvenile's county of residence for entry of a juvenile disposition only. Sentencing of a juvenile, including delayed imposition of sentence, may only be done in the county in which the offense occurred.

Rule 3.927 Prior Court Orders

(B) Return or Disposal of Exhibits. At the conclusion of a trial or hearing, the court shall direct the parties to retrieve the exhibits submitted by them except that any weapons and drugs shall be returned to the confiscating agency for proper disposition. If the exhibits are not retrieved by the parties as directed within 56 days after conclusion of the trial or hearing, the court may properly dispose of the exhibits without notice to the parties.

(C)   Confidentiality.

(1) must initiate the procedure required by MCL 257.321a for the failure to answer a citation, and

(2) may issue an order to apprehend the juvenile after a petition is filed with the court.

Rule 3.932 Summary Initial Proceedings
(A) Preliminary Inquiry. When a petition is not accompanied by a request for detention of the juvenile, the court may conduct a preliminary inquiry. Except in cases involving offenses enumerated in the Crime Victim's Rights Act, MCL 780.781(1)(g), the preliminary inquiry need not be conducted on the record. The court may, in the interest of the juvenile and the public:

(1) deny authorization of the petition;

(2) refer the matter to a public or private agency providing available services pursuant to the Juvenile Diversion Act, MCL 722.821 et seq.;

(3) direct that the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian be notified to appear for further informal inquiry on the petition;

(4) proceed on the consent calendar as provided in subrule (C); or

(5) place the matter on the formal calendar as provided in subrule (D).

(B) Offenses Listed in the Crime Victim's Rights Act. A case involving the alleged commission of an offense listed in the Crime Victim's Rights Act, MCL 780.781(1)(g), may only be removed from the adjudicative process upon compliance with the procedures set forth in that act. See MCL 780.786b.

(C) Consent Calendar.

(1) If the court determines that formal jurisdiction should not be acquired over the juvenile, the court may proceed with the case on the consent calendar. A case transferred to the consent calendar shall be transferred before disposition but may occur any time after receiving a petition, citation, or appearance ticket. Upon transfer, the clerk of the court shall make the case nonpublic.

(2) A case shall not be placed on the consent calendar unless the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the prosecutor, agree to have the case placed on the consent calendar. A case involving the alleged commission of an offense as that term is defined in section 31 of the Crime Victim’s Rights Act, MCL 780.781 et seq., shall only be placed on the consent calendar upon compliance with procedures set forth in MCL 780.786b.

(3) Biometric Data. Except as otherwise required by law, a juvenile shall not have biometric data collected unless the court has authorized the petition. If the court authorizes the petition and the juvenile is alleged to have committed an offense that requires the juvenile to have biometric data collected according to law, the court shall ensure the juvenile has biometric data collected before placing the case on consent calendar under subrule (C)(1).

(4) Victim Notice. After a case is placed on consent calendar, the prosecutor shall provide the victim notice as required by article 2 of the Crime Victim’s Rights act, MCL 780.781 to 780.802.

(5) Conference. After placing a matter on the consent calendar, the court shall conduct a consent calendar case conference with the juvenile, the juvenile’s attorney, if any, and the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or legal custodian. The prosecutor and victim may, but need not, be present. At the conference, the court shall discuss the allegations with the juvenile and issue a written consent calendar case plan in accordance with MCL 712A.2f(7).

(6) Case Plan. The case plan is not an order of the court, but shall be included as part of the case record. If the court determines the juvenile has violated the terms of the case plan, it may transfer the case to the formal calendar in accordance with subrule (C)(9).

(7) Disposition. The court shall not enter an order of disposition in a case while it is on the consent calendar.

(8) Access to Consent Calendar Case Records. Records of consent calendar proceedings shall be nonpublic. Access to consent calendar case records is governed by MCL 712A.2f(5).

(9) Transfer to Formal Calendar. If it appears to the court at any time that proceeding on the consent calendar is not in the best interest of either the juvenile or the public, the court may transfer the case from the consent calendar to the formal calendar. The court shall proceed with the case where court proceedings left off before the case was placed on the consent calendar.

(a) If the original petition was not authorized before being placed on the consent calendar, the court may, without hearing, transfer the case from the consent calendar to the formal calendar on the charges contained in the original petition to determine whether the petition should be authorized.

(b) If the original petition was authorized before being placed on the consent calendar, the court shall conduct a hearing on the record before transferring the case to the formal calendar. At the hearing, the court shall:

(i) Advise the juvenile that any statements made during the consent calendar proceedings cannot be used against the juvenile at a trial on the same charge.

(ii) Allow the juvenile and the juvenile’s attorney, if any, the opportunity to address the court and state on the record why the case should not be transferred to the formal calendar.

(10) Closing the Case. Upon a judicial determination that the juvenile has completed the terms of the consent calendar case plan, the court shall report the successful completion to the juvenile and the Department of State Police. The report to the Department of State police shall be in a form prescribed by the Department of State Police.

(11) Record Retention. The case records shall only be destroyed in accordance with the approved record retention and disposal schedule established by the State Court Administrative Office.

(D) Formal Calendar. The court may authorize a petition to be filed and docketed on the formal calendar if it appears to the court that formal court action is in the best interest of the juvenile and the public. The court shall not authorize an original petition under MCL 712A.2(a)(1), unless the prosecuting attorney has approved submitting the petition to the court. At any time before disposition, the court may transfer the matter to the consent calendar.

Rule 3.933 Acquiring Physical Control of Juvenile
(A) Custody Without Court Order. When an officer apprehends a juvenile for an offense without a court order and does not warn and release the juvenile, does not refer the juvenile to a diversion program, and does not have authorization from the prosecuting attorney to file a complaint and warrant charging the juvenile with an offense as though an adult pursuant to MCL 764.1f, the officer may:

(1) issue a citation or ticket to appear at a date and time to be set by the court and release the juvenile;

(2) accept a written promise of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian to bring the juvenile to court, if requested, at a date and time to be set by the court, and release the juvenile to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian; or

(3) take the juvenile into custody and request the prosecutor to file a petition, if:

(a) the officer has reason to believe that because of the nature of the offense, the interest of the juvenile or the interest of the public would not be protected by release of the juvenile, or

(b) a parent, guardian, or legal custodian cannot be located or has refused to take custody of the juvenile.

(B) Custody With Court Order. When a petition is presented to the court, and probable cause exists to believe that a juvenile has committed an offense, the court may issue an order to apprehend the juvenile. The order may include authorization to

(1) enter specified premises as required to bring the juvenile before the court, and

(2) detain the juvenile pending preliminary hearing.

(C) Notification of Court. The officer who apprehends a juvenile must immediately contact the court when:

(1) the officer detains the juvenile,

(2) the officer is unable to reach a parent, guardian, or legal custodian who will appear promptly to accept custody of the juvenile, or

(3) the parent, guardian, or legal custodian will not agree to bring the juvenile to court as provided in subrule (A)(2).

(D) Separate Custody of Juvenile. While awaiting arrival of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, appearance before the court, or otherwise, the juvenile must be maintained separately from adult prisoners to prevent any verbal, visual, or physical contact with an adult prisoner.

Rule 3.934 Arranging Court Appearance; Detained Juvenile
(A) General. Unless the prosecuting attorney has authorized a complaint and warrant charging the juvenile with an offense as though an adult pursuant to MCL 764.1f, when a juvenile is apprehended and not released, the officer shall:

(1) forthwith take the juvenile

(a) before the court for a preliminary hearing, or

(b) to a place designated by the court pending the scheduling of a preliminary hearing;

(2) ensure that the petition is prepared and presented to the court;

(2) Designated Court Person. The court must designate a judge, referee, or other person who may be contacted by the officer taking a juvenile into custody when the court is not open. In each county there must be a designated facility open at all times at which an officer may obtain the name of the person to be contacted for permission to detain the juvenile pending preliminary hearing.

Rule 3.935 Preliminary Hearing
(A) Time.

(1) Commencement. The preliminary hearing must commence no later than 24 hours after the juvenile has been taken into court custody, excluding Sundays and holidays, as defined by MCR 8.110(D)(2), or the juvenile must be released.

(2) General Adjournment. The court may adjourn the hearing for up to 14 days:

(a) to secure the attendance of the juvenile's parent, guardian, or legal custodian or of a witness, or

(b) for other good cause shown.

(3) Special Adjournment; Specified Juvenile Violation. This subrule applies to a juvenile accused of an offense that allegedly was committed between the juvenile's 14th and 18th birthdays and that would constitute a specified juvenile violation listed in MCL 712A.2(a)(1).

(a) On a request of a prosecuting attorney who has approved the submission of a petition with the court, conditioned on the opportunity to withdraw it within 5 days if the prosecuting attorney authorizes the filing of a complaint and warrant with a magistrate, the court shall comply with subrules (i)-(iii).

(i) The court shall adjourn the preliminary hearing for up to 5 days to give the prosecuting attorney the opportunity to determine whether to authorize the filing of a criminal complaint and warrant charging the juvenile with an offense as though an adult pursuant to MCL 764.1f, instead of unconditionally approving the filing of a petition with the court.

(ii) The court, during the special adjournment under subrule 3(a), must defer a decision regarding whether to authorize the filing of the petition.

(iii) The court, during the special adjournment under subrule (3)(a), must release the juvenile pursuant to MCR 3.935(E) or detain the juvenile pursuant to MCR 3.935(D).

(b) If, at the resumption of the preliminary hearing following special adjournment, the prosecuting attorney has not authorized the filing with a magistrate of a criminal complaint and warrant on the charge concerning the juvenile, approval of the petition by the prosecuting attorney shall no longer be deemed conditional and the court shall proceed with the preliminary hearing and decide whether to authorize the petition to be filed.

(c) This rule does not preclude the prosecuting attorney from moving for a waiver of jurisdiction over the juvenile under MCR 3.950.

(B) Procedure.

(1) The court shall determine whether the parent, guardian, or legal custodian has been notified and is present. The preliminary hearing may be conducted without a parent, guardian, or legal custodian present, provided a guardian ad litem or attorney appears with the juvenile.

(2) The court shall read the allegations in the petition.

(3) The court shall determine whether the petition should be dismissed, whether the matter should be referred to alternate services pursuant to the Juvenile Diversion Act, MCL 722.821 et seq., whether the matter should be heard on the consent calendar as provided by MCR 3.932(C), or whether to continue the preliminary hearing.

(4) If the hearing is to continue, the court shall advise the juvenile on the record in plain language of:

(a) the right to an attorney pursuant to MCR 3.915(A)(1);

(c) the privilege against self-incrimination and that any statement by the juvenile may be used against the juvenile.

(5) If the charge is a status offense in violation of MCL 712A.2(a)(2)-(4) or (d), the court must inquire if the juvenile or a parent is a member of an Indian tribe.

(6) The juvenile must be allowed an opportunity to deny or otherwise plead to the allegations.

(7) Unless the preliminary hearing is adjourned, the court must decide whether to authorize the petition to be filed pursuant to MCR 3.932(D). If it authorizes the filing of the petition, the court must:

(a) determine if biometric data must be taken as provided by MCL 712A.11(5) and MCR 3.936; and

(b) determine if the juvenile should be released, with or without conditions, or detained, as provided in subrules (C)-(F).

(8) The juvenile may be detained pending the completion of the preliminary hearing if the conditions for detention under subrule (D) are established.

(C) Determination Whether to Release or Detain.

(1) Factors. In determining whether the juvenile is to be released, with or without conditions, or detained, the court shall consider the following factors:

(2) Findings. The court must state the reasons for its decision to grant or deny release on the record or in a written memorandum. The court's statement need not include a finding on each of the enumerated factors.

(D) Detention.

(1) Conditions for Detention. A juvenile may be ordered detained or continued in detention if the court finds probable cause to believe the juvenile committed the offense, and that one or more of the following circumstances are present:

(a) the offense alleged is so serious that release would endanger the public safety;

(b) the juvenile is charged with an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult and will likely commit another offense pending trial, if released, and

(i) another petition is pending against the juvenile,

(ii) the juvenile is on probation, or

(iii) the juvenile has a prior adjudication, but is not under the court's jurisdiction at the time of apprehension;

(c) there is a substantial likelihood that if the juvenile is released to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, with or without conditions, the juvenile will fail to appear at the next court proceeding;

(d) the home conditions of the juvenile make detention necessary;

The court may require a parent, guardian, or legal custodian to post a surety bond or cash in the full amount of the bail, at the option of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian. A surety bond must be written by a person or company licensed to write surety bonds in Michigan. Except as otherwise provided by this rule, MCR 3.604 applies to bonds posted under this rule.

(2) Option to Deposit Cash or 10 Percent of Bail. Unless the court requires a surety bond or cash in the full amount of the bail as provided in subrule (F)(1), the court shall advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the option to satisfy the monetary requirement of bail by:

(a) The court must immediately mail notice of the forfeiture order to the parent at the last known address and to any surety.

(b) If the juvenile does not appear and surrender to the court within 28 days from the forfeiture date, or does not within the period satisfy the court that the juvenile is not at fault, the court may enter judgment against the parent and surety, if any, for the entire amount of the bail and, when allowed, costs of the court proceedings.

(D) Order for Destruction of Biometric Data. The court, on motion filed pursuant to MCL 28.243(10), shall issue an order directing the Department of State Police, or other official holding the information, to destroy the biometric data and arrest card of the juvenile pertaining to the offense, other than an offense as listed in MCL 28.243(14), when a juvenile has had biometric data collected for a juvenile offense and no petition on the offense is submitted to the court, the court does not authorize the petition, or the court has neither placed the case on the consent calendar nor taken jurisdiction of the juvenile under MCL 712A.2(a)(1).

Rule 3.937 Advice of Appellate Rights

(a) the name of the offense charged,

(a) either by questioning the juvenile or by other means when the plea is a plea of admission, or

(b) by means other than questioning the juvenile when the juvenile pleads no contest. The court shall also state why a plea of no contest is appropriate.

Rule 3.942 Trial
(A) Time. In all cases the trial must be held within 6 months after the authorization of the petition, unless adjourned for good cause. If the juvenile is detained, the trial has not started within 63 days after the juvenile is taken into custody, and the delay in starting the trial is not attributable to the defense, the court must immediately order the juvenile released pending trial without requiring that bail be posted, unless the juvenile is being detained on another matter.

(C) Evidence; Standard of Proof. The Michigan Rules of Evidence and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt apply at trial.

(D) Verdict. In a delinquency proceeding, the verdict must be guilty or not guilty of either the offense charged or a lesser included offense.

Rule 3.943 Dispositional Hearing
(A) General. A dispositional hearing is conducted to determine what measures the court will take with respect to a juvenile and, when applicable, any other person, once the court has determined following trial or plea that the juvenile has committed an offense.

(B) Time. The interval between the plea of admission or trial and disposition, if any, is within the court's discretion. When the juvenile is detained, the interval may not be more than 35 days, except for good cause.

(C) Evidence.

(1) The Michigan Rules of Evidence, other than those with respect to privileges, do not apply at dispositional hearings. All relevant and material evidence, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value, even though such evidence may not be admissible at trial.

(D) Presence of Juvenile and Victim.

(1) The juvenile may be excused from part of the dispositional hearing for good cause shown, but must be present when the disposition is announced.

(2) The victim has the right to be present at the dispositional hearing and to make an impact statement as provided by the Crime Victim's Rights Act, MCL 780.751 et seq. 

(E) Dispositions.

(1) If the juvenile has been found to have committed an offense, the court may enter an order of disposition as provided by MCL 712A.18.

(2) In making second and subsequent dispositions in delinquency cases, the court must consider imposing increasingly severe sanctions, which may include imposing additional conditions of probation; extending the term of probation; imposing additional costs; ordering a juvenile who has been residing at home into an out-of-home placement; ordering a more restrictive placement; ordering state wardship for a child who has not previously been a state ward; or any other conditions deemed appropriate by the court. Waiver of jurisdiction to adult criminal court, either by authorization of a warrant or by judicial waiver, is not considered a sanction for the purpose of this rule.

(a) institutional care is in the best interests of the juvenile,

(b) equivalent facilities to meet the juvenile's needs are not available within Michigan, and

(c) the placement will not cause undue hardship.

(4) The court shall not enter an order of disposition for a juvenile offense until the court verifies that the juvenile has had biometric data collected. If the juvenile has not had biometric data collected, the court shall proceed as provided by MCR 3.936.

(5) If the court enters an order pursuant to the Crime Victim's Rights Act, MCL 780.751 et seq., the court shall only order the payment of one assessment at any dispositional hearing, regardless of the number of offenses.

(B) Detention Hearing; Procedure. At the detention hearing:

(1) The court must determine whether a parent, guardian, or legal custodian has been notified and is present. If a parent, guardian, or legal custodian has been notified, but fails to appear, the detention hearing may be conducted without a parent, guardian, or legal custodian if a guardian ad litem or attorney appears with the juvenile.

(2) The court must provide the juvenile with a copy of the petition alleging probation violation.

(3) The court must read the petition to the juvenile, unless the attorney or juvenile waives the reading.

(4) The court must advise the juvenile of the juvenile's rights as provided in subrule (C)(1) and of the possible dispositions.

(a) If the juvenile admits the probation violation or pleads no contest, and the court accepts the plea, the court may modify the existing order of probation or may order any disposition available under MCL 712A.18 or MCL 712A.18a.

(b) If the juvenile denies the probation violation or remains silent, the court must schedule a probation violation hearing, which must commence within 42 days. The court may order the juvenile detained without bond pending the probation violation hearing if there is probable cause to believe the juvenile violated probation. If the hearing is not commenced within 42 days, and the delay in commencing the hearing is not attributable to the juvenile, the juvenile must be released pending hearing without requiring that bail be posted.

(c) If the juvenile is taken into custody for violating a court order under MCL 712A.2(a)(2) to (4) and is detained in a secure facility, the petitioner shall ensure that an appropriately trained, licensed, or certified mental health or substance abuse professional interviews the juvenile in person within 24 hours to assess the immediate mental health and substance abuse needs of the juvenile. The assessment may alternatively be done upon filing of the petition, prior to any order for placement in a secure facility. The completed assessment shall be provided to the court within 48 hours of the placement and the court shall conduct a hearing to determine all of the following:

(i) If there is reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile violated the court order.

(ii) The appropriate placement of the juvenile pending the disposition of the alleged violation, including if the juvenile should be placed in a secure facility.

(C) Probation Violation Hearing.

(1) At the probation violation hearing, the juvenile has the following rights:

(a) the right to be present at the hearing,

(b) the right to an attorney pursuant to MCR 3.915(A)(1),

(c) the right to have the petitioner prove the probation violation by a preponderance of the evidence,

(d) the right to have the court order any witnesses to appear at the hearing,

(3) If it is alleged that the juvenile violated probation by having been found, pursuant to MCR 3.941 or MCR 3.942, to have committed an offense, the juvenile may then be found to have violated probation pursuant to this rule.

(D) Pleas of Admission or No Contest. If the juvenile wishes to admit the probation violation or plead no contest, before accepting the plea, the court must:

(1) tell the juvenile the nature of the alleged probation violation;

(2) tell the juvenile the possible dispositions;

(3) tell the juvenile that if the plea is accepted, the juvenile will not have a contested hearing of any kind, so the juvenile would give up the rights that the juvenile would have at a contested hearing, including the rights as provided in subrule (C)(1);

(4) confirm any plea agreement on the record;

(5) ask the juvenile if any promises have been made beyond those in the plea agreement and whether anyone has threatened the juvenile;

(6) establish support for a finding that the juvenile violated probation,

(a) by questioning the juvenile or by other means when the plea is a plea of admission, or

(b) by means other than questioning the juvenile when the juvenile pleads no contest. The court must also state why a plea of no contest is appropriate;

(7) inquire of the parent, guardian, legal custodian, or guardian ad litem whether there is any reason why the court should not accept the juvenile's plea. Agreement or objection by the parent, guardian, legal custodian, or guardian ad litem to a plea of admission or of no contest by a juvenile shall be placed on the record if the parent, guardian, legal custodian, or guardian ad litem is present; and

(8) determine that the plea is accurately, voluntarily and understandingly made.

(E) Disposition of Probation Violation; Reporting.

(1) If, after hearing, the court finds that a violation of probation has occurred, the court may modify the existing order of probation or order any disposition available under MCL 712A.18 or MCL 712A.18a.

(2) If, after hearing, the court finds that the juvenile has violated a court order under MCL 712A.2(a)(2) to (4), and the juvenile is ordered to be placed in a secure facility, the order shall include all of the following individualized findings by the court:

(a) The court order the juvenile violated;

(b) The factual basis for determining that there was a reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile violated the court order;

(c) The court’s finding of fact to support a determination that there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative placement available considering the best interests of the juvenile;

(d) The length of time, not to exceed 7 days, that the juvenile may remain in the secure facility and the plan for the juvenile’s release from the facility; and

(e) The order may not be renewed or extended.

(3) If, after hearing, the court finds that a violation of probation occurred on the basis of the juvenile having committed an offense, that finding must be recorded as a violation of probation only and not a finding that the juvenile committed the underlying offense. That finding must not be reported to the State Police or the Secretary of State as an adjudication or a disposition.

(F) Determination of Ability to Pay. A juvenile and/or parent shall not be detained or incarcerated for the nonpayment of court-ordered financial obligations as ordered by the court, unless the court determines that the juvenile and/or parent has the resources to pay and has not made a good-faith effort to do so.

Rule 3.945 Dispositional Review
(A) Dispositional Review Hearings.

(1) Generally. The court must conduct periodic hearings to review the dispositional orders in delinquency cases in which the juvenile has been placed outside the home. Such review hearings must be conducted at intervals designated by the court, or may be requested at any time by a party or by a probation officer or caseworker. The victim has a right to make a statement at the hearing or submit a written statement for use at the hearing, or both. At a dispositional review hearing, the court may modify or amend the dispositional order or treatment plan to include any disposition permitted by MCL 712A.18 and MCL 712A.18a or as otherwise permitted by law; and shall permit the court to approve or disapprove of the child’s initial or continued placement in a qualified residential treatment. The Michigan Rules of Evidence, other than those with respect to privileges, do not apply.

(2) Required Review Hearings.

(a) If the juvenile is placed in out-of-home care, the court must hold dispositional review hearings no later than every 182 days after the initial disposition, as provided in MCL 712A.19(2).

(b) A review hearing is required before a juvenile is moved to a more physically restrictive type of placement, unless the court in its dispositional order has provided for a more physically restrictive type of placement. A review hearing is not required if the juvenile and a parent consent to the new placement in a writing filed with the court. A juvenile, who has been ordered placed in a juvenile facility, may be released only with the approval of the court.

(c) At a review hearing held under this section, the court shall approve or disapprove of a child’s initial placement or continued placement in a qualified residential treatment program.

(B) Hearing to Extend Jurisdiction.

(1) When Required. When a juvenile committed under MCL 712A.18(1)(e) for an offense specified in MCL 712A.18d remains under court jurisdiction after the juvenile's 18th birthday, the court must conduct a hearing to determine whether to extend the court's jurisdiction to age 21, pursuant to MCL 712A.18d.

(a) Time of Hearing. Unless adjourned for good cause, a commitment review hearing must be held as nearly as possible to, but before, the juvenile's 19th birthday.

(b) Notice of Hearing. Notice of the hearing must be given to the prosecuting attorney, the agency or the superintendent of the institution or facility to which the juvenile has been committed, the juvenile, and, if the address or whereabouts are known, the parent, guardian or legal custodian of the juvenile, at least 14 days before the hearing. The notice must clearly indicate that the court may extend jurisdiction over the juvenile until the juvenile reaches 21 years of age and must include advice to the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian that the juvenile has the right to an attorney.

(2) Appointment of Attorney. The court must appoint an attorney to represent the juvenile at the hearing unless an attorney has been retained.

(3) Evidence; Commitment Report. The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply, other than those with respect to privileges. The institution, agency, or facility must prepare a report for use at the hearing to extend jurisdiction. The report must contain information required by MCL 803.225. The court must consider this information in determining whether to extend jurisdiction beyond the age of 19.

(4) Burden of Proof; Findings. The court must extend jurisdiction over the juvenile until the age of 21, unless the juvenile proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and does not present a serious risk to public safety. In making the determination, the court must consider the following factors:

(a) the extent and nature of the juvenile's participation in education, counseling, or work programs;

(b) the juvenile's willingness to accept responsibility for prior behavior;

(c) the juvenile's behavior in the current placement;

(d) the juvenile's prior record, character, and physical and mental maturity;

(e) the juvenile's potential for violent conduct, as demonstrated by prior behavior;

(f) the recommendations of the institution, agency, or facility charged with the juvenile's care regarding the appropriateness of the juvenile's release or continued custody; and

(g) any other information the prosecuting attorney or the juvenile submits.

(C) Review of Extended Jurisdiction Cases.

(1) Out-of-Home Care. If the juvenile is placed outside the home, the court must hold a dispositional review hearing no later than every 182 days after the hearing to extend jurisdiction.

(2) Periodic Review. If the institution, agency, or facility to which the juvenile was committed believes that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and does not present a serious risk to public safety, the institution, agency, or facility may petition the court to conduct a review hearing at any time before the juvenile becomes 21 years of age.

(D) Juvenile on Conditional Release. The procedures set forth in MCR 3.944 apply to juveniles committed under MCL 712A.18 who have allegedly violated a condition of release after being returned to the community on release from a public institution. The court need not conduct such a hearing when there will be an administrative hearing by the agency to which the juvenile is committed, provided the court has not retained jurisdiction.

Rule 3.946 Post-Dispositional Secure Detention Pending Return to Placement
(A) If a juvenile who has been found to have committed an offense that would be a misdemeanor or a felony if committed by an adult has been placed out of the home by court order or by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the juvenile leaves such placement without authority, upon being apprehended the juvenile may be detained without the right to bail. Any detention must be authorized by the court.

(B) If a juvenile is placed in secure detention pursuant to this rule and no new petition is filed that would require a preliminary hearing pursuant to MCR 3.935, and no probation violation petition is filed, the court must conduct a detention hearing within 48 hours after the juvenile has been taken into custody, excluding Sundays and holidays as defined by MCR 8.110(D)(2).

(C) At the detention hearing the court must:

(1) assure that the custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian has been notified, if that person's whereabouts are known,

(2) advise the juvenile of the right to be represented by an attorney,

(3) determine whether the juvenile should be released or should continue to be detained.

Rule 3.947 Other Placement Review Proceedings
(A) Review of Juvenile’s Placement in A Qualified Residential Treatment Program.

(1) Ex Parte Petition for Review. Within 45 days of the juvenile’s initial placement in a qualified residential treatment program, the Agency shall file an ex parte petition requesting the court approve or disapprove the placement.

(a) Supporting Documents. The petition shall be accompanied by the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual.

(b) Service. The Agency shall serve the ex parte petition and accompanying documentation on all parties.

(2) Judicial Determination. Within 14 days of filing, the court, or an administrative body appointed or approved by the court independently, shall review the petition, and any supporting documentation filed pursuant to this subrule, and issue an order approving or disapproving of the placement. The order shall include individualized findings by the court or administrative body as to whether:

(a) the needs of the juvenile can be met in a foster family home, and if not,

(b) whether placement of the juvenile provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the juvenile in the least restrictive environment, and

(c) whether that placement is consistent with the goals in the permanency plan for the juvenile.

The court shall serve the order on parties. The court is not required to hold a hearing on the ex parte petition under this subrule.

Rule 3.950 Waiver of Jurisdiction
(A) Authority. Only a judge assigned to hear cases in the family division of the circuit court of the county where the offense is alleged to have been committed may waive jurisdiction pursuant to MCL 712A.4.

(B) Definition. As used in this rule, “felony” means an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or an offense designated by law as a felony.

(C) Motion by Prosecuting Attorney. A motion by the prosecuting attorney requesting that the family division waive its jurisdiction to a court of general criminal jurisdiction must be in writing and must clearly indicate the charges and that if the motion is granted the juvenile will be prosecuted as though an adult.

(1) A motion to waive jurisdiction of the juvenile must be filed within 14 days after the petition has been authorized to be filed. Absent a timely motion and good cause shown, the juvenile shall no longer be subject to waiver of jurisdiction on the charges.

(2) A copy of the motion seeking waiver must be personally served on the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, if their addresses or whereabouts are known or can be determined by the exercise of due diligence.

(D) Hearing Procedure. The waiver hearing consists of two phases. Notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings may be given either on the record directly to the juvenile or to the attorney for the juvenile, the prosecuting attorney, and all other parties, or in writing, served on each individual.

(1) First Phase. The first-phase hearing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed that if committed by an adult would be a felony, and that there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile who is 14 years of age or older committed the offense.

(a) The probable cause hearing must be commenced within 28 days after the authorization of the petition unless adjourned for good cause.

(b) At the hearing, the prosecuting attorney has the burden to present legally admissible evidence to establish each element of the offense and to establish probable cause that the juvenile committed the offense.

(c) The court need not conduct the first phase of the waiver hearing, if:

(i) the court has found the requisite probable cause at a hearing under MCR 3.935(D)(1), provided that at the earlier hearing only legally admissible evidence was used to establish probable cause that the offense was committed and probable cause that the juvenile committed the offense; or

(ii) the juvenile, after being informed by the court on the record that the probable cause hearing is equivalent to and held in place of preliminary examination in district court, waives the hearing. The court must determine that the waiver of hearing is freely, voluntarily, and understandingly given and that the juvenile knows there will be no preliminary examination in district court if the court waives jurisdiction.

(2) Second Phase. If the court finds the requisite probable cause at the first-phase hearing, or if there is no hearing pursuant to subrule (D)(1)(c), the second-phase hearing shall be held to determine whether the interests of the juvenile and the public would best be served by granting the motion. However, if the juvenile has been previously subject to the general criminal jurisdiction of the circuit court under MCL 712A.4 or 600.606, the court shall waive jurisdiction of the juvenile to the court of general criminal jurisdiction without holding the second-phase hearing.

(a) The second-phase hearing must be commenced within 28 days after the conclusion of the first phase, or within 35 days after the authorization of the petition if there was no hearing under subrule (D)(1)(c), unless adjourned for good cause.

(b) The Michigan Rules of Evidence, other than those with respect to privileges, do not apply to the second phase of the waiver hearing.

(c) The prosecuting attorney has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the best interests of the juvenile and the public would be served by waiver.

(d) The court, in determining whether to waive the juvenile to the court having general criminal jurisdiction, shall consider and make findings on the following criteria, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile's prior record of delinquency than to the other criteria:

(i) the seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the effect on any victim;

(ii) the culpability of the juvenile in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines;

(iii) the juvenile's prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior;

(iv) the juvenile's programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile's past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming;

(v) the adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system;

(vi) the dispositional options available for the juvenile.

(e) In determining whether to waive the juvenile to the court having general criminal jurisdiction, the court may also consider any stipulation by the defense to a finding that the best interests of the juvenile and the public support a waiver.

(E) Grant of Waiver Motion.

(1) If the court determines that it is in the best interests of the juvenile and public to waive jurisdiction over the juvenile, the court must:

(a) Enter a written order granting the motion to waive jurisdiction and transferring the matter to the appropriate court having general criminal jurisdiction for arraignment of the juvenile on an information.

(b) Make findings of fact and conclusions of law forming the basis for entry of the waiver order. The findings and conclusions may be incorporated in a written opinion or stated on the record.

(c) Advise the juvenile, orally or in writing, that

(i) the juvenile is entitled to appellate review of the decision to waive jurisdiction,

(ii) the juvenile must seek review of the decision in the Court of Appeals within 21 days of the order to preserve the appeal of right, and

(iii) if the juvenile is financially unable to retain an attorney, the court will appoint one to represent the juvenile on appeal.

(d) The court shall send, without cost, a copy of the order and a copy of the written opinion or transcript of the court's findings and conclusions, to the court having general criminal jurisdiction.

(2) Upon the grant of a waiver motion, a juvenile must be transferred to the adult criminal justice system and is subject to the same procedures used for adult criminal defendants. Juveniles waived pursuant to this rule are required to be kept separate and apart from adult prisoners as required by MCL 764.27a.

(F) Denial of Waiver Motion. If the waiver motion is denied, the court shall make written findings or place them on the record. A transcript of the court's findings or, if a written opinion is prepared, a copy of the written opinion must be sent to the prosecuting attorney and the juvenile, or juvenile's attorney, upon request. If the juvenile is detained and the trial of the matter in the family division has not started within 28 days after entry of the order denying the waiver motion, and the delay is not attributable to the defense, the court shall forthwith order the juvenile released pending trial without requiring that bail be posted, unless the juvenile is being detained on another matter.

(G) Psychiatric Testimony.

(1) A psychiatrist, psychologist, or certified social worker who conducts a court-ordered examination for the purpose of a waiver hearing may not testify at a subsequent criminal proceeding involving the juvenile without the juvenile's written consent.

(2) The juvenile's consent may only be given:

(a) in the presence of an attorney representing the juvenile or, if no attorney represents the juvenile, in the presence of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian;

(b) after the juvenile has had an opportunity to read the report of the psychiatrist, psychologist, or certified social worker; and

(c) after the waiver decision is rendered.

(3) Consent to testimony by the psychiatrist, psychologist, or certified social worker does not waive the juvenile's privilege against self-incrimination.

(3) Factors to be Considered. In determining whether to designate the case for trial in the same manner as an adult, the court must consider all the following factors, giving greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile's prior delinquency record than to the other factors:

(a) the seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the effect on any victim;

(b) the culpability of the juvenile in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile's participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines;

(c) the juvenile's prior record of delinquency, including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior;

(i) schedule a preliminary examination within 14 days if the juvenile is charged with a felony or an offense for which an adult could be imprisoned for more than one year, or

(ii) schedule the matter for trial or pretrial hearing if the juvenile is charged with a misdemeanor.

(b) Make findings of fact and conclusions of law forming the basis for entry of the order designating the petition. The findings and conclusions may be incorporated in a written opinion or stated on the record.

(E) Denial of Request for Designation. If the request for court designation is denied, the court shall make written findings or place them on the record. Further proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to MCR 3.941-3.944.

(3) If the court finds there is probable cause to believe that a lesser included offense was committed and probable cause to believe the juvenile committed that offense, the court may, as provided in MCR 3.952, further determine whether the case should be designated as a case in which the juvenile should be tried in the same manner as an adult. If the court designates the case following the determination of probable cause under this subrule, the court may schedule the matter for trial or a pretrial hearing.

(G) Confinement. If the court has designated the case and finds probable cause to believe that a felony or an offense for which an adult could be imprisoned for more than one year has been committed and probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the offense, the judge may confine the juvenile in the county jail pending trial.

If the court determines that the juvenile should be sentenced as an adult, the court may, in its discretion, enter an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence and placing the juvenile on probation on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, including ordering any disposition under MCL 712A.18. A delayed sentence may be imposed in accordance with MCR 3.956.

(A) Review Hearings in Delayed Imposition of Sentence Cases.

(1) When Required. If the court entered an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence, the court shall conduct a review hearing to determine whether the juvenile has been rehabilitated and whether the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety.

(a) Time of Hearing.

(i) Annual Review. The court shall conduct an annual review of the probation, including, but not limited to, the services being provided to the juvenile, the juvenile's placement, and the juvenile's progress in placement. In conducting the review, the court must examine any report prepared under MCL 803.223, and any report prepared by the officer or agency supervising probation. The court may order changes in the juvenile's probation on the basis of the review including, but not limited to, imposition of sentence.

(ii) Review on Request of Institution or Agency. If an institution or agency to which the juvenile was committed believes that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and does not present a serious risk to public safety, the institution or agency may petition the court to conduct a review hearing at any time before the juvenile becomes 19 years of age or, if the court has extended jurisdiction, any time before the juvenile becomes 21 years of age.

(iii) Mandatory Review. The court shall schedule a review hearing to be held within 42 days before the juvenile attains the age of 19, unless adjourned for good cause.

(iv) Final Review. The court shall conduct a final review of the juvenile's probation not less than 91 days before the end of the probation period.

(b) Notice of Hearing. Notice of the hearing must be given at least 14 days before the hearing to

(i) the prosecuting attorney;

(iii) the juvenile; and

(iv) if the address or whereabouts are known, the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile.

The notice must clearly indicate that the court may extend jurisdiction over the juvenile or impose sentence and must advise the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile that the juvenile has a right to an attorney.

(2) Appointment of Attorney. The court must appoint an attorney to represent the juvenile unless an attorney has been retained. The court may assess the cost of providing an attorney as costs against the juvenile or those responsible for the juvenile's support, or both, if the persons to be assessed are financially able to comply.

(3) Evidence; Commitment Report. The court may consider the commitment report prepared as provided in MCL 803.225 and any report prepared upon the court's order by the officer or agency supervising probation.

(4) Burden of Proof; Findings.

(a) Before the court may continue jurisdiction over the juvenile or impose sentence, the prosecuting attorney must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile has not been rehabilitated or that the juvenile presents a serious risk to public safety. The Michigan Rules of Evidence, other than those with respect to privileges, do not apply. In making the determination, the court must consider the following factors:

(i) the extent and nature of the juvenile's participation in education, counseling, or work programs;

(ii) the juvenile's willingness to accept responsibility for prior behavior;

(iii) the juvenile's behavior in the current placement;

(iv) the juvenile's prior record, character, and physical and mental maturity;

(v) the juvenile's potential for violent conduct as demonstrated by prior behavior;

(vi) the recommendation of the institution, agency, or facility charged with the juvenile's care for the juvenile's release or continued custody;

(vii) any other information the prosecuting attorney or the juvenile submit.

(b) Before the court may impose a sentence at the final review hearing, the court must determine that the best interests of the public would be served by the imposition of a sentence provided by law for an adult offender. In making the determination, the court must consider the following factors, in addition to the criteria specified in subrule (4)(a):

(i) the effect of treatment on the juvenile's rehabilitation;

(ii) whether the juvenile is likely to be dangerous to the public if released;

(iii) the best interests of the public welfare and the protection of public security.

(5) Sentencing credit. If a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, the juvenile shall receive credit for the time served on probation.

(B) Violation of Probation in Delayed Imposition of Sentence Cases.

(1) Subsequent Conviction. If a juvenile placed on probation under an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence is found by the court to have violated probation by being convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, or adjudicated as responsible for an offense that if committed by an adult would be a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, the court shall revoke probation and sentence the juvenile to imprisonment for a term that does not exceed the penalty that could have been imposed for the offense for which the juvenile was originally convicted and placed on probation.

(2) Other Violations of Probation. If a juvenile placed on probation under an order of disposition delaying imposition of sentence is found by the court to have violated probation other than as provided in subrule (B)(1), the court may impose sentence or may order any of the following for the juvenile:

(a) A change in placement.

(b) Community service.

(c) Substance abuse counseling.

(d) Mental health counseling.

(e) Participation in a vocational-technical program.

(f) Incarceration in the county jail for not more than 30 days if the present county jail facility would meet all requirements under federal law and regulations for housing juveniles, and if the court has consulted with the sheriff to determine when the sentence will begin to ensure that space will be available for the juvenile. If the juvenile is under 18 years of age, the juvenile must be placed in a room or ward out of sight and sound from adult prisoners.

(g) Other participation or performance as the court considers necessary.

(3) Hearing. The probation violation hearing must be conducted pursuant to MCR 3.944(C).

(4) Sentencing Credit. If a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, the juvenile must receive credit for the time served on probation.

(C) Determination of Ability to Pay. A juvenile and/or parent shall not be detained or incarcerated for the nonpayment of court-ordered financial obligations as ordered by the court, unless the court determines that the juvenile and/or parent has the resources to pay and has not made a good-faith effort to do so.

Rule 3.961 Initiating Child Protective Proceedings
(A) Form. Absent exigent circumstances, a request for court action to protect a child must be in the form of a petition. The form, captioning, signing, and verifying of documents are prescribed in MCR 1.109(D) and (E).

(5) The child's membership or eligibility for membership in an Indian tribe, if any, and the identity of the tribe.

(6) The type of relief requested. A request for removal of the child or a parent or for termination of parental rights at the initial disposition must be specifically stated. If the petition requests removal of an Indian child or if an Indian child was taken into protective custody pursuant to MCR 3.963 as a result of an emergency, the petition must specifically describe:

(a)   the active efforts as defined in MCR 3.002, that have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family; and

(b) documentation, including attempts, to identify the child’s tribe.

(C)   Amended and Supplemental Petitions.

(1)   If a nonrespondent parent is being added as an additional respondent to a petition that has been authorized by the court under MCR 3.962 or MCR 3.965 against the first respondent parent, and the first respondent parent has not made a plea under MCR 3.971 or a trial has not been conducted under MCR 3.972, the allegations against the second respondent shall be filed in an amended petition.

(2)   If a nonrespondent parent is being added as an additional respondent in a case in which a petition has been authorized under MCR 3.962 or MCR 3.965, and adjudicated by plea under MCR 3.971 or by trial under MCR 3.972, the allegations against the second respondent shall be filed in a supplemental petition.

(3)   If either an amended or supplemental petition is not accompanied by a request for placement of the child or the child is not in protective or temporary custody, the court shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine the appropriate action to be taken on a petition. If either the amended or supplemental petition contains a request for removal, the court shall conduct a preliminary hearing to determine the appropriate action to be taken on the petition consistent with MCR 3.965(B). If either the amended or supplemental petition is authorized, the court shall proceed against each respondent parent in accordance with MCR 3.971 or MCR 3.972.



Rule 3.962 Preliminary Inquiry
(A) Purpose. When a petition is not accompanied by a request for placement of the child and the child is not in temporary custody, the court may conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine the appropriate action to be taken on a petition.

(B) Action by Court. A preliminary inquiry need not be conducted on the record or in the presence of the parties. At the preliminary inquiry, the court may:

(1) Deny authorization of the petition.

(2) Refer the matter to alternative services.

(3) Authorize the filing of the petition if it contains the information required by MCR 3.961(B), and there is probable cause to believe that one or more of the allegations is true. For the purpose of this subrule, probable cause may be established with such information and in such a manner as the court deems sufficient.

Rule 3.963 Acquiring Physical Custody of Child
(A) Taking Custody Without Court Order.

(1) An officer may without court order remove a child from the child's surroundings and take the child into protective custody if, after investigation, the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a child is at substantial risk of harm or is in surroundings that present an imminent risk of harm and the child’s immediate removal from those surroundings is necessary to protect the child’s health and safety. If the child is an Indian child who resides or is domiciled on a reservation, but is temporarily located off the reservation, the officer may take the child into protective custody only when necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

(2)    An officer who takes a child into protective custody under this rule shall immediately notify the Department of Health and Human Services. While awaiting the arrival of the Department of Health and Human Services, the child shall not be held in a detention facility.

(3)    If a child taken into protective custody under this subrule is not released, the Department of Health and Human Services shall immediately contact the designated judge or referee as provided in subrule (D) to seek an ex parte court order for placement of the child pursuant to subrule (B)(4).

(B) Court-Ordered Custody.

(1) Order to Take Child into Protective Custody. The court may issue a written order, electronically or otherwise, authorizing a child protective services worker, an officer, or other person deemed suitable by the court to immediately take a child into protective custody when, after presentment of a petition or affidavit of facts to the court, the court has reasonable cause to believe that all the following conditions exist, together with specific findings of fact:

(a)    The child is at substantial risk of harm or is in surroundings that present an imminent risk of harm and the child’s immediate removal from those surroundings is necessary to protect the child’s health and safety. If the child is an Indian child who resides or is domiciled on a reservation, but is temporarily located off the reservation, the child is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal court. However, the state court may enter an order for protective custody of that child when it is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

   (b)    The circumstances warrant issuing an order pending a hearing in accordance with:

(i)   MCR 3.965 for a child who is not yet under the jurisdiction of the court, or

(ii)   MCR 3.974(C) for a child who is already under the jurisdiction of the court under MCR 3.971 or 3.972.

(c)    Consistent with the circumstances, reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child.

(d)    No remedy other than protective custody is reasonably available to protect the child.

(e)    Continuing to reside in the home is contrary to the child’s welfare.

(2) The court may include in such an order authorization to enter specified premises to remove the child.

(3) The court shall inquire whether a member of the child's immediate or extended family is available to take custody of the child pending a preliminary hearing, or an emergency removal hearing if the court already has jurisdiction over the child under MCR 3.971 or MCR 3.972, whether there has been a central registry clearance, and whether a criminal history check has been initiated.

(4)    Ex parte Placement Order. If an officer has taken a child into protective custody without court order under subrule (A), or if the Department of Health and Human Services is requesting the court grant it protective custody and placement authority, the Department of Health and Human Services shall present to the court a petition or affidavit of facts and request a written ex parte placement order. If a judge finds all the factors in subrule (B)(1)(a)-(e) are present, the judge may issue a placement order; if a referee finds all the factors in subrule (B)(1)(a)-(e) are present, the referee may issue an interim placement order pending a preliminary hearing. The written order shall contain specific findings of fact. It shall be communicated, electronically or otherwise, to the Department of Health and Human Services.

(C) Arranging for Court Appearance. An officer or other person who takes a child into protective custody must:

(1) immediately attempt to notify the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the protective custody;

(2) inform the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the date, time, and place of the preliminary or emergency removal hearing scheduled by the court;

(3) immediately bring the child to the court for preliminary hearing, or immediately contact the court for instructions regarding placement pending preliminary hearing;

(4) if the court is not open, DHHS must contact the person designated under subrule (D) for permission to place the child pending the hearing;

(5) ensure that the petition is prepared and submitted to the court;

(6) file a custody statement with the court that includes:

(a)   a specific and detailed account of the circumstances that led to the emergency removal, and

(b)   the names of persons notified and the times of notification or the reason for failure to notify.

(D)    Designated Court Contact

(1) When the Department of Health and Human Services seeks a placement order for a child in protective custody under subrule (A) or (B), DHHS shall contact a judge or referee designated by the court for that purpose.

(2)    If the court is closed, the designated judge or referee may issue an ex parte order for placement upon receipt, electronically or otherwise, of a petition or affidavit of facts. The order must be communicated in writing, electronically or otherwise, to the appropriate county DHHS office and filed with the court the next business day.



Rule 3.965 Preliminary Hearing
(A) Time for Preliminary Hearing.

(1) Child in Protective Custody. The preliminary hearing must commence no later than 24 hours after the child has been taken into protective custody, excluding Sundays and holidays, as defined by MCR 8.110(D)(2), unless adjourned for good cause shown, or the child must be released.

(2) Severely Physically Injured or Sexually Abused Child. When the Department of Health and Human Services submits a petition in cases in which the child has been severely physically injured, as that term is defined in MCL 722.628(3)(c), or sexually abused, and subrule (A)(1) does not apply, the preliminary hearing must commence no later than 24 hours after the agency submits a petition or on the next business day following the submission of the petition.

(B) Procedure.

(1) The court must determine if the parent, guardian, or legal custodian has been notified, and if the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child is present. The preliminary hearing may be adjourned for the purpose of securing the appearance of an attorney, parent, guardian, or legal custodian or may be conducted in the absence of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian if notice has been given or if the court finds that a reasonable attempt to give notice was made.

(2)    The court must inquire if the child or either parent is a member of an Indian tribe. If the court knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian child, the court must determine the identity of the child’s tribe and, if the child was taken into protective custody pursuant to MCR 3.963(A) or the petition requests removal of the child, follow the procedures set forth in MCR 3.967. If necessary, the court may adjourn the preliminary hearing pending the conclusion of the removal hearing. A removal hearing may be held in conjunction with the preliminary hearing if all necessary parties have been notified as required by MCR 3.905, there are no objections by the parties to do so, and at least one qualified expert witness is present to provide testimony.

(3) The child's lawyer-guardian ad litem must be present to represent the child at the preliminary hearing. The court may make temporary orders for the protection of the child pending the appearance of an attorney or pending the completion of the preliminary hearing. The court must direct that the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child receive a copy of the petition.

(4) If the respondent is present, the court must assure that the respondent has a copy of the petition. The court must read the allegations in the petition in open court, unless waived.

(5) The court shall determine if the petition should be dismissed or the matter referred to alternate services. If the court so determines the court must release the child. Otherwise, the court must continue the hearing.

(6) The court must advise the respondent of the right to the assistance of an attorney at the preliminary hearing and any subsequent hearing pursuant to MCR 3.915(B)(1)(a).

(7) The court must advise the respondent of the right to trial on the allegations in the petition and that the trial may be before a referee unless a demand for a jury or judge is filed pursuant to MCR 3.911 or 3.912.

(8) The court must advise a nonrespondent parent of his or her right to seek placement of his or her children in his or her home.

(9) The court shall allow the respondent an opportunity to deny or admit the allegations and make a statement of explanation.

(10) The court must inquire whether the child is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of another court and, if so, which court.

(11) The court may adjourn the hearing for up to 14 days to secure the attendance of witnesses or for other good cause shown. If the court knows or has reason to know the child is an Indian, the court may adjourn the hearing for up to 21 days to ensure proper notice to the tribe or Secretary of the Interior as required by MCR 3.920(C)(1). If the preliminary hearing is adjourned, the court may make temporary orders for the placement of the child when necessary to assure the immediate safety of the child, pending the completion of the preliminary hearing and subject to subrule (C), and as applicable, MCR 3.967.

(12) Unless the preliminary hearing is adjourned, the court must decide whether to authorize the filing of the petition and, if authorized, whether the child should remain in the home, be returned home, or be placed in foster care pending trial. The court may authorize the filing of the petition upon a showing of probable cause, unless waived, that one or more of the allegations in the petition are true and fall within MCL 712A.2(b). The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply, other than those with respect to privileges, except to the extent that such privileges are abrogated by MCL 722.631.

(13) If the court authorizes the filing of the petition, the court:

(a) may release the child to a parent, guardian, or legal custodian and may order such reasonable terms and conditions believed necessary to protect the physical health or mental well-being of the child; or

(b) may order placement of the child after making the determinations specified in subrule (C), if those determinations have not previously been made. If the child is an Indian child, the child must be placed in descending order of preference with:

(i)    a member of the child’s extended family,

(ii)    a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the child’s tribe,

(iii)    an Indian foster family licensed or approved by the department,

(iv)    an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs.

   The court may order another placement for good cause shown in accordance with MCL 712B.23(3)-(5). If the Indian child’s tribe has established a different order of preference than the order prescribed above, placement shall follow that tribe’s order of preference as long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in MCL 712B.23(6). The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements above shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.

(14) The court must inquire of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian regarding the identity of relatives of the child who might be available to provide care. If the father of the child has not been identified, the court must inquire of the mother regarding the identity and whereabouts of the father.

(15) If the court orders removal of the child from a parent’s care or custody, the court shall advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the right to appeal that action.

(C) Pretrial Placement.

(1) Placement; Proofs. If the child was not released under subrule (B), the court shall receive evidence, unless waived, to establish that the criteria for placement set forth in subrule 3.965(C)(2) are present. The respondent shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to subpoena witnesses, and to offer proofs to counter the admitted evidence.

(2) Criteria. The court may order placement of the child into foster care if the court finds all of the following:

(a)    Custody of the child with the parent presents a substantial risk of harm to the child’s life, physical health, or mental well-being.

(b)    No provision of service or other arrangement except removal of the child is reasonably available to adequately safeguard the child from the risk as described in subrule (a).

(c)    Continuing the child’s residence in the home is contrary to the child’s welfare.

(d)    Consistent with the circumstances, reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child.

(e)    Conditions of child custody away from the parent are adequate to safeguard the child’s health and welfare.

(3) Contrary to the Welfare Findings. Contrary to the welfare findings must be made. If placement is ordered, the court must make a statement of findings, in writing or on the record, explicitly including the finding that it is contrary to the welfare of the child to remain at home and the reasons supporting that finding. If the “contrary to the welfare of the child” finding is placed on the record and not in a written statement of findings, it must be capable of being transcribed. The findings may be made on the basis of hearsay evidence that possesses adequate indicia of trustworthiness. If continuing the child’s residence in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child, the court shall not return the child to the home, but shall order the child placed in the most family-like setting available consistent with the child’s needs.

(4)    Reasonable Efforts Findings. Reasonable efforts findings must be made. In making the reasonable efforts determination under this subrule, the child’s health and safety must be of paramount concern to the court. When the court has placed a child with someone other than the custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court must determine whether reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of the child have been made or that reasonable efforts to prevent removal are not required. The court must make this determination at the earliest possible time, but no later than 60 days from the date of removal, and must state the factual basis for the determination in the court order. Nunc pro tunc orders or affidavits are not acceptable. Reasonable efforts to prevent a child's removal from the home are not required if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that

(a)    the parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances as listed in sections 18(1) and (2) of the Child Protection Law, MCL 722.638(1) and (2); or

(b)    the parent has been convicted of 1 or more of the following:

(i)    murder of another child of the parent,

(ii)    voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent,

(iii)    aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit such a murder or such a voluntary manslaughter, or

(iv)    a felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent; or

(c) parental rights of the parent with respect to a sibling have been terminated involuntarily; or

(d)    the parent is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act.

(5) Record Checks; Home Study. If the child has been placed in a relative’s home,

(a) the court may order the Department of Health and Human Services to report the results of a criminal record check and central registry clearance of the residents of the home to the court before, or within 7 days after, the placement, and

(b) the court must order the Department of Health and Human Services to perform a home study with a copy to be submitted to the court not more than 30 days after the placement.

(6) No Right to Bail. No one has the right to post bail in a protective proceeding for the release of a child in the custody of the court.

(7) Parenting Time or Visitation.

(a) Unless the court suspends parenting time pursuant to MCL 712A.19b(4), or unless the child has a guardian or legal custodian, the court must permit each parent frequent parenting time with a child in placement unless parenting time, even if supervised, may be harmful to the child.

(b) If the child was living with a guardian or legal custodian, the court must determine what, if any, visitation will be permitted with the guardian or legal custodian.

(8) Medical Information. Unless the court has previously ordered the release of medical information, the order placing the child in foster care must include:

(a) an order that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian provide the supervising agency with the name and address of each of the child's medical providers, and

(b) an order that each of the child's medical providers release the child's medical records.

(D) Advice; Initial Service Plan. If placement is ordered, the court must, orally or in writing, inform the parties:

(1) that the agency designated to care and supervise the child will prepare an initial service plan no later than 30 days after the placement;

(2) that participation in the initial service plan is voluntary unless otherwise ordered by the court;

(3) that the general elements of an initial service plan include:

(a) the background of the child and the family,

(b) an evaluation of the experiences and problems of the child,

(c) a projection of the expected length of stay in foster care, and

(d) an identification of specific goals and projected time frames for meeting the goals;

(4) that, on motion of a party, the court will review the initial service plan and may modify the plan if it is in the best interests of the child; and

(5) that the case may be reviewed for concurrent planning.

The court shall direct the agency to identify, locate, and consult with relatives to determine if placement with a relative would be in the child’s best interests, as required by MCL 722.954a(2). In a case to which MCL 712A.18f(6) applies, the court shall require the agency to provide the name and address of the child’s attending physician of record or primary care physician.



Rule 3.966 Other Placement Review Proceedings
(A) Review of Placement Order and Initial Service Plan.

(1) On motion of a party, the court must review the placement order or the initial service plan, and may modify the order and plan if it is in the best interest of the child. If removal from the parent, guardian, or legal custodian is requested, at the hearing on the motion, the court shall follow the placement procedures in MCR 3.965(B) and (C).

(2) If the child is removed from the home and disposition is not completed, the court shall conduct a dispositional hearing in accordance with MCR 3.973.

(B) Petitions to Review Placement Decisions by Supervising Agency.

(1) General. The court may review placement decisions when all of the following apply:

(a) a child has been removed from the home;

(b) the supervising agency has made a placement decision after identifying, locating, and consulting with relatives to determine placement with a fit and appropriate relative who would meet the child's developmental, emotional, and physical needs as an alternative to nonrelative foster care;

(c) the supervising agency has provided written notice of the placement decision;

(d) a person receiving notice has disagreed with the placement decision and has given the child's lawyer-guardian ad litem written notice of the disagreement within 5 days of the date on which the person receives notice; and

(e) the child's lawyer-guardian ad litem determines the decision is not in the child's best interest.

(2) Petition for Review. If the criteria in subrule (1) are met, within 14 days after the date of the agency's written placement decision, the child's lawyer-guardian ad litem must file a petition for review.

(3) Hearing on Petition. The court must commence a review hearing on the record within 7 days of the filing of the petition.

(C) Disputes Between Agency and Foster Care Review Board Regarding Change In Placement.

(1) General. The court must conduct a hearing upon notice from the Foster Care Review Board that, after an investigation, it disagrees with a proposed change in placement by the agency of a child who is not a permanent ward of the Michigan Children’s Institute.

(2) Procedure.

(a) Time. The court must set the hearing no sooner than 7 days and no later than 14 days after receipt of the notice from the Foster Care Review Board that there is a disagreement regarding a placement change.

(b) Notice. The court must provide notice of the hearing date to the foster parents, each interested party, and the prosecuting attorney if the prosecuting attorney has appeared in the case.

(c) Evidence. The court may hear testimony from the agency and any other interested party. The court may consider any other evidence bearing upon the proposed change in placement. The Rules of Evidence do not apply to a hearing under this rule.

(d) Findings. The court must order the continuation or restoration of placement unless the court finds that the proposed change in placement is in the child's best interests.

(D) Review of Child’s Placement in a Qualified Residential Treatment Program

(1) Ex Parte Motion for Review. Within 45 days of the child’s initial placement in a qualified residential treatment program, the Agency shall file an ex parte motion requesting the court to approve or disapprove of the placement.

(a) Supporting Documents. The motion shall be accompanied by the assessment, determination, and documentation made by the qualified individual.

(b) Service. The Agency shall serve the ex parte motion and accompanying documentation on all parties.

(2) Judicial Determination. Within 14 days of filing, the court, or an administrative body appointed or approved by the court independently, shall review the motion, and any supporting documentation filed pursuant to this subrule, and issue an order approving or disapproving of the placement. The order shall include individualized findings by the court or administrative body as to:

(a) whether the needs of the child can be met in a foster family home, or if not,

(b) whether the placement of the child provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment, and

(c) whether the placement is consistent with the goals in the permanency plan for the child.

The court shall serve the order on parties. The court is not required to hold a hearing on the ex parte motion under this subrule.

Rule 3.967 Removal Hearing for Indian Child
(A)   Child in Protective Custody. If an Indian child is taken into protective custody pursuant to MCR 3.963(A) or (B) or MCR 3.974, a removal hearing must be completed within 14 days after removal from a parent or Indian custodian unless that parent or Indian custodian has requested an additional 20 days for the hearing pursuant to MCL 712B.9(2) or the court adjourns the hearing pursuant to MCR 3.923(G). Absent extraordinary circumstances that make additional delay unavoidable, temporary emergency custody shall not be continued for more than 45 days.

(B)   Child Not in Protective Custody. If an Indian child has not been taken into protective custody and the petition requests removal of that child, a removal hearing must be conducted before the court may enter an order removing the Indian child from the parent or Indian custodian.

(C)   Notice of the removal hearing must be sent to the parties prescribed in MCR 3.921 in compliance with MCR 3.920(C)(1).

(D)   Evidence. An Indian child may be removed from a parent or Indian custodian, or, for an Indian child already taken into protective custody pursuant to MCR 3.963 or MCR 3.974(B), remain removed from a parent or Indian custodian pending further proceedings, only upon clear and convincing evidence, including the testimony of at least one qualified expert witness, as described in MCL 712B.17, who has knowledge about the child-rearing practices of the Indian child’s tribe, that active efforts as defined in MCR 3.002 have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, that these efforts have proved unsuccessful, and that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. The active efforts must take into account the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the Indian child’s tribe.

(E)   A removal hearing may be combined with any other hearing.

(F)   The Indian child, if removed from home, must be placed in descending order of preference with:

(1)   a member of the child’s extended family,

(2)   a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the child’s tribe,

(3)   an Indian foster family licensed or approved by department,

(4)   an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs.

The court may order another placement for good cause shown in accordance with MCL 712B.23(3)-(5). If the Indian child’s tribe has established a different order of preference than the order prescribed in subrule (F), placement shall follow that tribe’s order of preference as long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in MCL 712B.23(6).

   The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements above shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.



Rule 3.970 Child Protection Mediation
(A) Scope and Applicability of Rule; Definitions.

(1) This rule applies to the mediation of child protective proceedings.

(2) "Mediation" includes dispute resolution processes in which a neutral third party facilitates communication between parties, assists in identifying issues, and helps explore solutions to promote a mutually acceptable settlement. A mediator or facilitator has no authoritative decision-making power.

(B) ADR Plan. Each trial court that submits child protective proceedings to mediation processes under this rule shall either incorporate the process into its current ADR plan, or if the court does not have an approved ADR plan, adopt an ADR plan by local administrative order under MCR 2.410(B).

(C) Order for Mediation.

(1) At any stage in the proceedings, after consultation with the parties, the court may order that a case be submitted to mediation.

(2) Unless a court first conducts a hearing to determine whether mediation is appropriate, the court shall not refer a case to mediation if the parties are subject to a personal protection order or other protective order. The court may order mediation without a hearing if a protected party requests mediation.



(3) In addition to other provisions the court considers appropriate, the order shall:

(a) specify, or make provision for selection of, the mediation provider;

(b) provide time limits for initiation and completion of the mediation process.

The court shall not order a party to pay a fee for mediation services.

(4) The order may require attendance at mediation proceedings as provided in subrule (E).

(D) Objections to Mediation. A party may orally object to an order to mediate or in writing. Cases may be exempt from mediation on the basis of the following:

(1) Domestic abuse, unless attorneys for both parties will be present at the mediation session;

(2) Inability of one or both parties to negotiate for themselves at the mediation, unless attorneys for both parties will be present at the mediation session;

(3) Reason to believe that one or both parties' health or safety would be endangered by mediation;

(4) A showing that the parties have made significant efforts to resolve the issues such that mediation is likely to be unsuccessful; or

(5) For other good cause shown.

(E) Attendance at Mediation Proceedings.

(1) Attendance of Counsel. The court may direct that the attorneys representing the parties attend mediation proceedings. If the attorney representing a party is unable to attend, another attorney associated with the representing attorney may attend, but must be familiar with the case.

(2) Presence of Parties. The court may direct that the parties to the action and other persons:

(a) be present at the mediation proceeding or be immediately available by some other means at the time of the proceeding; and

(b) have information and authority adequate for responsible and effective participation in the proceeding for all purposes.

The court's order may specify whether the availability is to be in person or by other means.

(3) Except for legal counsel, the parties may not bring other persons to the mediation session unless permission is first obtained from the mediator, after notice to opposing counsel.



(4) Failure to appear. The failure of a party to appear in accordance with this rule may be considered a contempt of court.

(F) Selection of the Mediator.

(1) The parties may stipulate to the selection of a mediator. A mediator selected by agreement of the parties need not meet the qualifications set forth in subrule (H). The court must appoint a mediator stipulated to by the parties, provided the mediator is willing to serve within a period that would not interfere with the court's scheduling of the case. If the parties do not stipulate to a particular mediator, the court may select a Community Dispute Resolution Program (CDRP) center or other mediator who meets the requirements of subrule (H).

(2) The rule for disqualification of a mediator is the same as that provided in MCR 2.003 for the disqualification of a judge. The mediator must promptly disclose any potential basis for disqualification.

(G) Scheduling and Mediation Process.

(1) Scheduling. The order referring the case for mediation shall specify the time within which the mediation is to be completed. A copy of the order shall be sent to each party, the CDRP center or the mediator selected. Upon receipt of the court's order, the CDRP center or mediator shall promptly confer with the parties to schedule mediation in accordance with the order. The mediator may direct the parties to submit in advance, or bring to the mediation, documents or summaries providing information about the case.

(2) The mediator must make reasonable inquiry as to whether either party has a history of a coercive or violent relationship with the other party. Throughout the mediation process, the mediator must make reasonable efforts to screen for the presence of coercion or violence that would make mediation physically or emotionally unsafe for any participant or that would impede achieving a voluntary and safe resolution of issues. A reasonable inquiry includes the use of the domestic violence screening protocol for mediators provided by the State Court Administrative Office as directed by the Supreme Court.

(3) Mediation Process. The mediator shall discuss with the parties and counsel, if any, the facts and issues involved. Mediation participants may ask to meet separately with the mediator throughout the mediation process. The mediation will continue until: an agreement is reached, the mediator determines that an agreement is not likely to be reached, the end of the first mediation session, or until a time agreed to by the parties. Additional sessions may be held as long as it appears to the mediator that the process may result in an agreement.

(4) Following their attendance at a mediation session, a party may withdraw from mediation without penalty at any time.

(5) Completion of Mediation. Within two days after the completion of the mediation process, the CDRP center or the mediator shall so advise the court, stating only: the date of completion of the process, who appeared at the mediation, whether an agreement was reached, and whether further mediation proceedings are contemplated. If an agreement was reached, the CDRP center or the mediator shall submit the agreement to the court within 14 days of the completion of mediation.

(6) Agreements reached in mediation are not binding unless the terms are incorporated in an order of the court or placed on the record and the court complies with MCR 3.971.

(7) Confidentiality. Confidentiality in the mediation process is governed by MCR 2.412. However, previously uninvestigated allegations of abuse or neglect identified during the mediation process are not confidential and may be disclosed. The mediator shall advise the parties, orally and in writing, of the rules regarding confidentiality under MCR 2.412 and MCL 722.631.

(H) Qualification of Mediators.

(1) To be eligible to serve as a mediator in child protection cases, a person must meet the following minimum qualifications:

(a) Complete a general civil or domestic relations mediation training program approved by the State Court Administrator providing the generally accepted components of mediation skills;

(b) Have one or more of the following:

(i) Juris doctor degree, graduate degree in conflict resolution or a behavioral science, or 5 years of experience in the child protection field; or

(ii) 40 hours of mediation experience over two years, including mediation, co-mediation, observation, and role-playing in the context of mediation.

(c) Upon completion of the training required under subrule (H)(1)(a), observe two general civil or domestic relations mediation proceedings conducted by an approved mediator, and conduct one general civil or domestic relations mediation to conclusion under the supervision and observation of an approved mediator.

(d) Complete a 15-hour advanced training program on child protection mediation practice and an 8-hour training program on domestic violence screening approved by the State Court Administrator.

(2) Approved mediators are required to complete 8 hours of advanced mediation training during each 2-year period.

(3) Additional requirements may not be imposed upon mediators.

Rule 3.971 Pleas of Admission or No Contest
(A) General. A respondent may make a plea of admission or of no contest to the original allegations in the petition. The court has discretion to allow a respondent to enter a plea of admission or a plea of no contest to an amended petition. The plea may be taken at any time after the authorization of the petition, provided that the petitioner and the attorney for the child have been notified of a plea offer to an amended petition and have been given the opportunity to object before the plea is accepted.

(B) Advice of Rights and Possible Disposition. Before accepting a plea of admission or plea of no contest, the court must advise the respondent on the record or in a writing that is made a part of the file:

(1) of the allegations in the petition;

(2) of the right to an attorney, if respondent is without an attorney;

(3) that, if the court accepts the plea, the respondent will give up the rights to

(a) trial by a judge or trial by a jury,

(b) have the petitioner prove the allegations in the petition by a preponderance of the evidence,

(c) have witnesses against the respondent appear and testify under oath at the trial,

(d) cross-examine witnesses, and

(e) have the court subpoena any witnesses the respondent believes could give testimony in the respondent's favor;

(4) of the consequences of the plea, including that the plea can later be used as evidence in a proceeding to terminate parental rights if the respondent is a parent.

(5) if parental rights are subsequently terminated, the obligation to support the child will continue until a court of competent jurisdiction modifies or terminates the obligation, an order of adoption is entered, or the child is emancipated by operation of law. Failure to provide required notice under this subsection does not affect the obligation imposed by law or otherwise establish a remedy or cause of action on behalf of the parent;

(6) that appellate review is available to challenge any errors in the adjudicatory process, which may be challenged in an appeal from the court’s initial order of disposition;

(7) that an indigent respondent is entitled to appointment of an attorney to represent the respondent on any appeal as of right and to preparation of transcripts; and

(8) the respondent may be barred from challenging the assumption of jurisdiction in an appeal from an order terminating parental rights if they do not timely file an appeal of the initial dispositional order under MCR 7.204 or a delayed appeal under MCR 3.993(C).

(C) Appellate Review. The respondent may challenge the assumption of jurisdiction in an appeal from the order terminating respondent's parental rights if the court fails to properly advise the respondent of their right to appeal pursuant to subrule (B)(6)-(8).

(D) Voluntary, Accurate Plea.

(1) Voluntary Plea. The court shall not accept a plea of admission or of no contest without satisfying itself that the plea is knowingly, understandingly, and voluntarily made.

(2) Accurate Plea. The court shall not accept a plea of admission or of no contest without establishing support for a finding that one or more of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition are true, preferably by questioning the respondent unless the offer is to plead no contest. If the plea is no contest, the court shall not question the respondent, but, by some other means, shall obtain support for a finding that one or more of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition are true. The court shall state why a plea of no contest is appropriate.

Rule 3.972 Trial
(A) Time. If the child is not in placement, the trial must be held within 6 months after the filing of the petition unless adjourned for good cause under MCR 3.923(G). If the child is in placement, the trial must commence as soon as possible, but not later than 63 days after the child is removed from the home unless the trial is postponed:

(1) on stipulation of the parties for good cause;

(2) because process cannot be completed; or

(3) because the court finds that the testimony of a presently unavailable witness is needed.

When trial is postponed pursuant to subrule (2) or (3), the court shall release the child to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian unless the court finds that releasing the child to the custody of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian will likely result in physical harm or serious emotional damage to the child.

If the child has been removed from the home, a review hearing must be held within 182 days of the date of the child’s removal from the home, even if the trial has not been completed before the expiration of that 182-day period.

(B) Preliminary Proceedings.

(1) The court shall determine that the proper parties are present. The respondent has the right to be present, but the court may proceed in the absence of the respondent provided notice has been served on the respondent. The child may be excused as the court determines the child's interests require.

(2) The court shall read the allegations in the petition, unless waived.

(C) Evidentiary Matters.

(1) Evidence; Standard of Proof. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, the rules of evidence for a civil proceeding and the standard of proof by a preponderance of evidence apply at the trial, notwithstanding that the petition contains a request to terminate parental rights.

(2) Child’s Statement. Any statement made by a child under 10 years of age or an incapacitated individual under 18 years of age with a developmental disability as defined in MCL 330.1100a(26) regarding an act of child abuse, child neglect, confirmed sexual abuse, or confirmed sexual exploitation, as defined in MCL 722.622(g), (k), (q), or (r), performed with or on the child by another person may be admitted into evidence through the testimony of a person who heard the child make the statement as provided in this subrule.

(a) A statement describing such conduct may be admitted regardless of whether the child is available to testify or not, and is substantive evidence of the act or omission if the court has found, in a hearing held before trial, that the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement provide adequate indicia of trustworthiness. This statement may be received by the court in lieu of or in addition to the child's testimony.

(b) If the child has testified, a statement denying such conduct may be used for impeachment purposes as permitted by the rules of evidence.

(c) If the child has not testified, a statement denying such conduct may be admitted to impeach a statement admitted under subrule (2)(a) if the court has found, in a hearing held before trial, that the circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement denying the conduct provide adequate indicia of trustworthiness.

(D) Recommendation by Lawyer-Guardian ad Litem. At the conclusion of the proofs, the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child may make a recommendation to the finder of fact regarding whether one or more of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition have been proven.

(E) Verdict. In a child protective proceeding, the verdict must be whether one or more of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition have been proven.

(F) Respondent's Rights Following Trial. If the trial results in a verdict that one or more statutory grounds for jurisdiction has been proven, the court shall advise the respondent orally or in writing that:

(1) appellate review is available to challenge any errors in the adjudicatory process, which may be challenged in an appeal from the court’s initial order of disposition,

(2) an indigent respondent is entitled to appointment of an attorney to represent the respondent on any appeal as of right and to preparation of transcripts, and

(3) the respondent may be barred from challenging the assumption of jurisdiction if they do not timely file an appeal under MCR 7.204 or a delayed appeal under MCR 3.993(C).

(G) Right to Appellate Review. The respondent may challenge the assumption of jurisdiction in an appeal from the order terminating respondent's parental rights if the court fails to properly advise the respondent of their right to appeal pursuant to subrule (F)(1)-(3).

Rule 3.973 Dispositional Hearing
(A) Purpose. A dispositional hearing is conducted to determine what measures the court will take with respect to a child properly within its jurisdiction and, when applicable, against any adult, once the court has determined following trial, plea of admission, or plea of no contest that one or more of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition are true.

(B) Notice. Unless the dispositional hearing is held immediately after the trial, notice of hearing may be given by scheduling it on the record in the presence of the parties or in accordance with MCR 3.920.

(C) Time. The interval, if any, between the trial and the dispositional hearing is within the discretion of the court. When the child is in placement, the interval may not be more than 28 days, except for good cause.

(D) Presence of Parties.

(1) The child may be excused from the dispositional hearing as the interests of the child require.

(2) The respondent has the right to be present or may appear through an attorney.

(3) The court may proceed in the absence of parties provided that proper notice has been given.

(E) Evidence; Reports.

(1) The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply at the initial dispositional hearing, other than those with respect to privileges. However, as provided by MCL 722.631, no assertion of an evidentiary privilege, other than the privilege between attorney and client, shall prevent the receipt and use, at the dispositional phase, of materials prepared pursuant to a court-ordered examination, interview, or course of treatment.

(2) All relevant and material evidence, including oral and written reports, may be received and may be relied on to the extent of its probative value. The court shall consider the case service plan and any written or oral information concerning the child from the child's parent, guardian, legal custodian, foster parent, child caring institution, or relative with whom the child is placed. If the agency responsible for the care and supervision of the child recommends not placing the child with the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the agency shall report in writing what efforts were made to prevent removal, or to rectify conditions that caused removal, of the child from the home.

(3) The parties shall be given an opportunity to examine and controvert written reports so received and may be allowed to cross-examine individuals making the reports when those individuals are reasonably available.

(4) Written reports, other than those portions made confidential by law, case service plans, and court orders, including all updates and revisions, shall be available to the foster parent, child caring institution, or relative with whom the child is placed. The foster parents, child caring institution, or relative with whom the child is placed shall not have the right to cross-examine individuals making such reports or the right to controvert such reports beyond the making of a written or oral statement concerning the child as provided in subrule (E)(2).

(5) Reports in the Agency’s case file, including but not limited to case services plans, treatment plans, substance abuse evaluations, psychological evaluations, therapists’ reports, drug and alcohol screening results, contracted service provider reports, and parenting time logs shall be provided to the court and parties no less than seven (7) days before the hearing.

(6)   The court, upon receipt of a local foster care review board’s report, shall include the report in the court’s confidential social file. The court shall ensure that all parties have had the opportunity to review the report and file objections before a dispositional order, dispositional review order, or permanency planning order is entered. The court may at its discretion include recommendations from the report in its orders.

(F) Dispositional Orders.

(1) The court shall enter an order of disposition as provided in the Juvenile Code and these rules.

(2) The court shall not enter an order of disposition until it has examined the case service plan as provided in MCL 712A.18f. The court may order compliance with all or part of the case service plan and may enter such orders as it considers necessary in the interest of the child.

(3) The court, on consideration of the written report prepared by the agency responsible for the care and supervision of the child pursuant to MCL 712A.18f(1), shall, when appropriate, include a statement in the order of disposition as to whether reasonable efforts were made:

(a) to prevent the child's removal from home, or

(b) to rectify the conditions that caused the child to be removed from the child's home.

(4) Medical Information. Unless the court has previously ordered the release of medical information, the order placing the child in foster care must include the following:

(a) an order that the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian provide the supervising agency with the name and address of each of the child's medical providers, and

(b) an order that each of the child's medical providers release the child's medical records.

(5) Child Support. The court may include an order requiring one or both of the child’s parents to pay child support. All child support orders entered under this subrule must comply with MCL 552.605 and MCR 3.211(D).

(G) Respondent's Rights Upon Entry of Dispositional Order. When the court enters an initial order of disposition following adjudication the court shall advise the respondent orally or in writing:

(1) that at any time while the court retains jurisdiction over the minor, the respondent may challenge the continuing exercise of that jurisdiction by filing a motion for rehearing under MCL 712A.21 or by filing an application for leave to appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals,

(2) that appellate review is available to challenge the court’s initial order of disposition following adjudication,

(3) that an indigent respondent is entitled to appointment of an attorney to represent the respondent on any appeal as of right and to preparation of transcripts, and

(4) the respondent may be barred from challenging the assumption of jurisdiction or the removal of the minor from a parent's care and custody in an appeal from the order terminating parental rights if they do not timely file an appeal under MCR 7.204 or a delayed appeal under MCR 3.993(C).

(H) Right to Appellate Review. The respondent may challenge the assumption of jurisdiction in an appeal from the order terminating respondent's parental rights if the respondent's parental rights are terminated at the initial dispositional hearing pursuant to MCR 3.977(E). In addition, the respondent may challenge the assumption of jurisdiction in an appeal from the order terminating respondent's parental rights if the court fails to properly advise the respondent of their right to appeal pursuant to subrule (G)(2)-(4).

(I) Subsequent Review. When the court does not terminate jurisdiction upon entering its dispositional order, it must:

(1) follow the review procedures in MCR 3.975 for a child in placement, or

(2) review the progress of a child at home pursuant to the procedures of MCR 3.974(A).

(J) Allegations of Additional Abuse or Neglect.

(1) Proceedings on a supplemental petition seeking termination of parental rights on the basis of allegations of additional abuse or neglect, as defined in MCL 722.622(g) and (k), of a child who is under the jurisdiction of the court are governed by MCR 3.977.

(2) Where there is no request for termination of parental rights, proceedings regarding allegations of additional abuse or neglect, as defined in MCL 722.622(g) and (k), of a child who is under the jurisdiction of the court, including those made under MCL 712A.19(1), are governed by MCR 3.974 for a child who is at home or MCR 3.975 for a child who is in foster care.

Rule 3.974 Procedures for Child at Home; Petition Authorized
(A) Review of Child's Progress.

(1) General. The court shall periodically review the progress of a child not in foster care over whom it has taken jurisdiction.

(2) Time. If the child was never removed from the home, the progress of the child must be reviewed no later than 182 days from the date the petition was authorized and no later than 91 days after that for the first year that the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. After that first year, a review hearing shall be held no later than 182 days from the immediately preceding review hearing before the end of the first year and no later than every 182 days from each preceding hearing until the court terminates its jurisdiction. The review shall occur no later than 182 days after the child returns home when the child is no longer in foster care. If the child was removed from the home and subsequently returned home, review hearings shall be held in accordance with MCR 3.975.

(3) Change of Placement. Except as provided in subrule (C), the court may not order a change in the placement of a child without a hearing. If the child for whom the court has authorized a petition remains at home or has otherwise returned home from foster care, and it comes to the court’s attention at a review hearing held pursuant to subrule (A)(2), or as otherwise provided in this rule, that the child should be removed from the home, the court may order the placement of the child. If the court orders the child to be placed out of the home following a review hearing held pursuant to subrule (A)(2), the parent must be present and the court shall comply with the placement provisions in MCR 3.965(C). If the parent is not present, the court shall proceed under subrule (C) before it may order removal. If the child is an Indian child, in addition to a hearing held in accordance with this rule, the court must also conduct a removal hearing in accordance with MCR 3.967 before it may order the placement of the Indian child.

(B)   Hearing on Petition for Out-of-Home Placement.

(1)   Preadjudication. If a child for whom a petition has been authorized under MCR 3.962 or MCR 3.965 is not yet under the jurisdiction of the court and an amended petition has been filed to remove the child from the home, the court shall conduct a hearing on the petition in accordance with MCR 3.965.

(2)   Postadjudication. If a child is under the jurisdiction of the court and a supplemental petition has been filed to remove the child from the home, the court shall conduct a hearing on the petition. The court shall ensure that the parties are given notice of the hearing as provided in MCR 3.920 and MCR 3.921. Unless the child remains in the home, the court shall comply with the placement provisions in MCR 3.965(C) and must make a written determination that the criteria for placement listed in MCR 3.965(C)(2) are satisfied. If the court orders that the child be placed out of the home, the court shall proceed under subrule (D).

(C) Emergency Removal; Protective Custody.

(1) General. If a child for whom the court has authorized an original petition remains at home or is returned home following a hearing pursuant to the rules in this subchapter, the court may order the child to be taken into protective custody pending an emergency removal hearing pursuant to the conditions listed in MCR 3.963(B)(1) and upon receipt, electronically or otherwise, of a petition or affidavit of fact. If the child is an Indian child and the child resides or is domiciled within a reservation, but is temporarily located off the reservation, the court may order the child to be taken into protective custody only when necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.

(2) Notice. The court shall ensure that the parties are given notice of the emergency removal hearing as provided in MCR 3.920 and MCR 3.921.

(3) Emergency Removal Hearing. If the court orders the child to be taken into protective custody under MCR 3.963, the court must conduct an emergency removal hearing no later than 24 hours after the child has been taken into custody, excluding Sundays and holidays as defined in MCR 8.110(D)(2). If the child is an Indian child, the court must also conduct a removal hearing in accordance with MCR 3.967 in order for the child to remain removed from a parent or Indian custodian.

(a)   Preadjudication. If a child for whom a petition has been authorized under MCR 3.962 or MCR 3.965 is not yet under the jurisdiction of the court, the emergency removal hearing shall be conducted in the manner provided by MCR 3.965.

(b)   Postadjudication. If a child is under the jurisdiction of the court, unless the child is returned to the parent pending disposition or dispositional review, the court shall comply with the placement provisions in MCR 3.965(C) and must make a written determination that the criteria for placement listed in MCR 3.965(C)(2) are satisfied. The parent, guardian, or legal custodian from whom the child was removed must be given an opportunity to state why the child should not be removed from, or should be returned to, the custody of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.

The respondent parent, guardian, or legal custodian from whom the child is removed must receive a written statement of the reasons for removal and be advised of the following rights at a hearing to be held under subrule (D):

(i) to be represented by an attorney at the hearing;

(ii) to contest the continuing placement at the hearing within 14 days; and

(iii) to use compulsory process to obtain witnesses for the hearing.

(D) Procedure Following Postadjudication Out-of-Home Placement. If the child is in placement under subrule (B)(2) or (C)(3)(b), the court shall proceed as follows:

(1)   If the court has not held a dispositional hearing under MCR 3.973, the court shall conduct the dispositional hearing within 28 days after the child is placed by the court, except for good cause shown.

(2)   If the court has already held a dispositional hearing under MCR 3.973, a dispositional review hearing must commence no later than 14 days after the child is placed by the court, except for good cause shown. The dispositional review hearing may be combined with the removal hearing for an Indian child prescribed by MCR 3.967. The dispositional review hearing must be conducted in accordance with the procedures and rules of evidence applicable to a dispositional hearing.

(3) The court shall advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the right to appeal the order removing the child from a parent’s care or custody.



Rule 3.975 Post-dispositional Procedures: Child in Foster Care
(A) Dispositional Review Hearings. A dispositional review hearing is conducted to permit court review of the progress made to comply with any order of disposition and with the case service plan prepared pursuant to MCL 712A.18f and court evaluation of the continued need and appropriateness for the child to be in foster care; and to permit the court to approve or disapprove of the child’s initial or continued placement in a qualified residential treatment program.

(B) Notice. The court shall ensure that written notice of a dispositional review hearing is given to the appropriate persons in accordance with MCR. 3.920 and MCR 3.921(B)(2). The notice must inform the parties of their opportunity to participate in the hearing and that any information they wish to provide should be submitted in advance to the court, the agency, the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child, or an attorney for one of the parties.

(C) Time. The court must conduct dispositional review hearings at intervals as follows, as long as the child remains in foster care:

(1) not more than 182 days after the child’s removal from his or her home and no later than every 91 days after that for the first year that the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. After the first year that the child has been removed from his or her home and is subject to the jurisdiction of the court, a review hearing shall be held not more than 182 days from the immediately preceding review hearing before the end of that first year and no later than every 182 days from each preceding review hearing thereafter until the case is dismissed; or

(2) if a child is under the care and supervision of the agency and is either placed with a relative and the placement is intended to be permanent or is in a permanent foster family agreement, not more than 182 days after the child has been removed from his or her home and no later than 182 days after that so long as the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the court, the Michigan Children’s Institute, or other agency as provided in MCR 3.976(E)(3).

A review hearing under this subrule shall not be canceled or delayed beyond the number of days required in this subrule, regardless of whether a petition to terminate parental rights or another matter is pending.

(D) Early Review Option. At the initial dispositional hearing and at every regularly scheduled dispositional review hearing, the court must decide whether it will conduct the next dispositional review hearing before what would otherwise be the next regularly scheduled dispositional review hearing as provided in subrule (C). In deciding whether to shorten the interval between review hearings, the court shall, among other factors, consider:

(1) the ability and motivation of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian to make changes needed to provide the child a suitable home environment;

(2) the reasonable likelihood that the child will be ready to return home earlier than the next scheduled dispositional review hearing.

(E) Procedure. Dispositional review hearings must be conducted in accordance with the procedures and rules of evidence applicable to the initial dispositional hearing. The Agency shall provide to all parties all reports in its case file, including but not limited to initial and updated case service plans, treatment plans, psychological evaluations, psychiatric evaluations, substance abuse evaluations, drug and alcohol screens, therapists’ reports, contracted service provider reports, and parenting time logs. The reports shall be provided to the parties at least seven (7) days before the hearing. The reports that are filed with the court must be offered into evidence. The court shall consider any written or oral information concerning the child from the child's parent, guardian, legal custodian, foster parent, child caring institution, or relative with whom a child is placed, in addition to any other relevant and material evidence at the hearing. The court, on request of a party or on its own motion, may accelerate the hearing to consider any element of a case service plan. The court, upon receipt of a local foster care review board’s report, shall include the report in the court’s confidential social file. The court shall ensure that all parties have had the opportunity to review the report and file objections before a dispositional order, dispositional review order, or permanency planning order is entered. The court may at its discretion include recommendations from the report in its orders.

(F) Criteria.

(1) Review of Case Service Plan. The court, in reviewing the progress toward compliance with the case service plan, must consider:

(a) the services provided or offered to the child and parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the child;

(b) whether the parent, guardian, or legal custodian has benefited from the services provided or offered;

(c) the extent of parenting time or visitation, including a determination regarding the reasons either was not frequent or never occurred;

(d) the extent to which the parent, guardian, or legal custodian complied with each provision of the case service plan, prior court orders, and any agreement between the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the agency;

(e) any likely harm to the child if the child continues to be separated from his or her parent, guardian, or custodian;

(f) any likely harm to the child if the child is returned to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian; and

(g)   if the child is an Indian child, whether the child’s placement remains appropriate and complies with MCR 3.967(F).

(2) Progress Toward Returning Child Home. The court must decide the extent of the progress made toward alleviating or mitigating conditions that caused the child to be, and to remain, in foster care. The court shall also review the concurrent plan, if applicable.

(3) Review of Placement in Qualified Residential Treatment Program. Where a child remains placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the court shall review the evidence submitted by the Agency, approve or disapprove of the placement, and make individualized findings as to:

(a) whether the needs of the child can be met through placement in a foster home; or if not,

(b) whether the placement provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment; and

(c) whether the placement is consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child.

(G) Dispositional Review Orders. The court, following a dispositional review hearing, may:

(1) order the return of the child home,

(2) change the placement of the child,

(3) modify the dispositional order,

(4) modify any part of the case service plan,

(5) enter a new dispositional order, or

(6) continue the prior dispositional order.

(H) Returning Child Home Without Dispositional Review Hearing. Unless notice is waived, if not less than 7 days written notice is given to all parties before the return of a child to the home, and if no party requests a hearing within the 7 days, the court may issue an order without a hearing permitting the agency to return the child home.

Rule 3.976 Permanency Planning Hearings
(A) Permanency Plan. At or before each permanency planning hearing, the court must determine whether the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan. At the hearing, the court must review the permanency plan for a child in foster care. The court must determine whether and, if applicable, when:

(1) the child may be returned to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian;

(2) a petition to terminate parental rights should be filed;

(3) the child may be placed in a legal guardianship;

(4) the child may be permanently placed with a fit and willing relative; or

(5) the child may be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement, but only in those cases where the agency has documented to the court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child to follow one of the options listed in subrules (1)-(4).

(B) Time.

(1) An initial permanency planning hearing must be held within 28 days after a judicial determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the family or to prevent removal are not required given one of the following circumstances:

(a) There has been a judicial determination that the child’s parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances as listed in sections 18(1) and (2) of the Child Protection Law, 1975 PA 238, MCL 722.638.

(b) The parent has been convicted of one of the following:

(i) murder of another child of the parent;

(ii) voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent;

(iii) aiding or abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit such a murder or such a voluntary manslaughter; or

(iv) a felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent.

(c) The parent has had rights to one of the child’s siblings involuntarily terminated.

(2) If subrule (1) does not apply, the court must conduct an initial permanency planning hearing no later than 12 months after the child’s removal from the home, regardless of whether any supplemental petitions are pending in the case.

(3) Requirement of Annual Permanency Planning Hearings. During the continuation of foster care, the court must hold permanency planning hearings beginning no later than 12 months after the initial permanency planning hearing. The interval between permanency planning hearings is within the discretion of the court as appropriate to the circumstances of the case, but must not exceed 12 months. The court may combine the permanency planning hearing with a review hearing.

(4) The judicial determination to finalize the court-approved permanency plan must be made within the time limits prescribed in subsections (1)-(3).

(C) Notice. The parties entitled to participate in a permanency planning hearing include the:

(1) parents of the child, if the parent’s parental rights have not been terminated,

(2) child, if the child is of an appropriate age to participate,

(3) guardian,

(4) legal custodian,

(5) foster parents,

(6) pre-adoptive parents,

(7) relative caregivers, and

(8) if the child is an Indian child, the child’s tribe.

Written notice of a permanency planning hearing must be given as provided in MCR 3.920 and MCR 3.921(B)(2). The notice must include a brief statement of the purpose of the hearing, and must include a notice that the hearing may result in further proceedings to terminate parental rights. The notice must inform the parties of their opportunity to participate in the hearing and that any information they wish to provide should be submitted in advance to the court, the agency, the lawyer-guardian ad litem for the child, or an attorney for one of the parties.

(D) Hearing Procedure; Evidence.

(1) Procedure. Each permanency planning hearing must be conducted by a judge or a referee. Paper reviews, ex parte hearings, stipulated orders, or other actions that are not open to the participation of (a) the parents of the child, unless parental rights have been terminated; (b) the child, if of appropriate age; and (c) foster parents or preadoptive parents, if any, are not permanency planning hearings.

(2) Evidence. The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply, other than those with respect to privileges, except to the extent such privileges are abrogated by MCL 722.631. At the permanency planning hearing all relevant and material evidence, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value. The court must consider any written or oral information concerning the child from the child's parent, guardian, custodian, foster parent, child caring institution, or relative with whom the child is placed, in addition to any other evidence offered at the hearing. The court shall obtain the child’s views regarding the permanency plan in a manner appropriate to the child’s age. The parties must be afforded an opportunity to examine and controvert written reports received and may be allowed to cross-examine individuals who made the reports when those individuals are reasonably available.

(3)   The court, upon receipt of a local foster care review board’s report, shall include the report in the court’s confidential social file. The court shall ensure that all parties have had the opportunity to review the report and file objections before a dispositional order, dispositional review order, or permanency planning order is entered. The court may at its discretion include recommendations from the report in its orders.

(4) Written reports in the Agency case file, including but not limited to case service plans, treatment plans, substance abuse evaluations, psychological evaluations, therapists’ reports, drug and alcohol screens, contracted service provider reports, and parenting time logs, shall be provided to the court and parties no less than seven (7) days before the hearing.

(E) Determinations; Permanency Options.

(1) In the case of a child who will not be returned home, the court shall consider in-state and out-of-state placement options. In the case of a child placed out of state, the court shall determine whether the out-of-state placement continues to be appropriate and in the child’s best interests. The court shall ensure that the agency is providing appropriate services to assist a child who will transition from foster care to independent living.

(2) Determining Whether to Return Child Home. At the conclusion of a permanency planning hearing, the court must order the child returned home unless it determines that the return would cause a substantial risk of harm to the life, the physical health, or the mental well-being of the child. Failure to substantially comply with the case service plan is evidence that the return of the child to the parent may cause a substantial risk of harm to the child's life, physical health, or mental well-being. In addition, the court shall consider any condition or circumstance of the child that may be evidence that a return to the parent would cause a substantial risk of harm to the child’s life, physical health, or mental well-being. If the court does not order the child returned home, and the child remains in a qualified residential treatment program, the court shall:

(a) review the evidence submitted by the Agency, approve or disapprove of the placement, and make individualized findings as to:

(i) whether the needs of the child can be met through placement in a family foster home; or if not,

(ii) whether the placement provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment; and

(iii) whether the placement is consistent with the short- and longterm goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan of the child.

(3) Continuing Foster Care Pending Determination on Termination of Parental Rights. If the court determines at a permanency planning hearing that the child should not be returned home, it may order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the state for 15 of the most recent 22 months, the court shall order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights. If the court orders the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights, the order must specify the date, or the time within which the petition must be filed. In either case, the petition must be filed no later than 28 days after the date the permanency planning hearing is concluded. The court is not required to order the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights if one or more of the following apply:

   (a)   The child is being cared for by relatives.

   (b)   The case service plan documents a compelling reason for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child. A compelling reason not to file a petition to terminate parental rights includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:

      (i)   Adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal for the child.

      (ii)   No grounds to file a petition to terminate parental rights exist.

      (iii)   The child is an unaccompanied refugee minor as defined in 45 CFR 400.111.

      (iv)   There are international legal obligations or compelling foreign policy reasons that preclude terminating parental rights.

(c)   The state has not provided the child’s family, during the period set in the case service plan, with the services the state considers necessary for the child’s safe return to his or her home, if reasonable efforts to reunify the family are required.

If the court does not require the agency to initiate proceedings to terminate parental rights under this provision, the court shall state on the record the reason or reasons for its decision.

(4) Other Permanency Plans. If the court does not return the child to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and if the agency demonstrates that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child, the court may

(a) continue the placement of the child in foster care for a limited period to be set by the court while the agency continues to make reasonable efforts to finalize the court-approved permanency plan for the child,

(b) place the child with a fit and willing relative,

(c) upon a showing of compelling reasons, place the child in an alternative planned permanent living arrangement, or

(d) appoint a juvenile guardian for the child pursuant to MCL 712A.19a and MCR 3.979.

The court must articulate the factual basis for its determination in the court order adopting the permanency plan.

Rule 3.977 Termination of Parental Rights
(A) General.

(1) This rule applies to all proceedings in which termination of parental rights is sought. Proceedings for termination of parental rights involving an Indian child, are governed by 25 USC 1912 in addition to this rule.

(a) the agency,

(b) the child,

(c) the guardian, legal custodian, or representative of the child,

(d) a concerned person as defined in MCL 712A.19b(6),

(e) the state children's ombudsman, or

(f) the prosecuting attorney, without regard to whether the prosecuting attorney is representing or acting as a legal consultant to the agency or any other party.

(3) The burden of proof is on the party seeking by court order to terminate the rights of the respondent over the child. There is no right to a jury determination.

(B) Definition. When used in this rule, unless the context otherwise indicates, “respondent” includes

(1) the natural or adoptive mother of the child;

(2) the father of the child as defined by MCR 3.903(A)(7).

“Respondent” does not include other persons to whom legal custody has been given by court order, persons who are acting in the place of the mother or father, or other persons responsible for the control, care, and welfare of the child.

(C) Notice; Priority.

(1) Notice must be given as provided in MCR 3.920 and MCR 3.921(B)(3).

(2) Hearings on petitions seeking termination of parental rights shall be given the highest possible priority consistent with the orderly conduct of the court’s caseload.

(D) Suspension of Parenting Time. If a petition to terminate parental rights to a child is filed, the court may suspend parenting time for a parent who is a subject of the petition.

(E) Termination of Parental Rights at the Initial Disposition. The court shall order termination of the parental rights of a respondent at the initial dispositional hearing held pursuant to MCR 3.973, and shall order that additional efforts for reunification of the child with the respondent shall not be made, if

(1) the original, or amended, petition contains a request for termination;

(2) at the trial or plea proceedings, the trier of fact finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the grounds for assumption of jurisdiction over the child under MCL 712A.2(b) have been established;

(3) at the initial disposition hearing, the court finds on the basis of clear and convincing legally admissible evidence that had been introduced at the trial or plea proceedings, or that is introduced at the dispositional hearing, that one or more facts alleged in the petition:

(a) are true, and

(b) establish grounds for termination of parental rights under MCL 712A.19b(3)(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), or (m);

   (4) termination of parental rights is in the child’s best interests.

(F) Termination of Parental Rights on the Basis of Different Circumstances. The court may take action on a supplemental petition that seeks to terminate the parental rights of a respondent over a child already within the jurisdiction of the court on the basis of one or more circumstances new or different from the offense that led the court to take jurisdiction.

(1) The court must order termination of the parental rights of a respondent, and must order that additional efforts for reunification of the child with the respondent must not be made, if

(a) the supplemental petition for termination of parental rights contains a request for termination;

(b) at the hearing on the supplemental petition, the court finds on the basis of clear and convincing legally admissible evidence that one or more of the facts alleged in the supplemental petition:

(2) Discovery and Time for Disclosures and Hearing on Petition. Parties shall make disclosures as detailed in MCR 3.922(A) at least 21 days prior to the termination hearing and have rights to discovery consistent with that rule. The hearing on a supplemental petition for termination of parental rights under this subrule shall be held within 42 days after the filing of the supplemental petition. The court may, for good cause shown, extend the period for an additional 21 days.

(G)   Termination of Parental Rights; Indian Child

In addition to the required findings in this rule, the parental rights of a parent of an Indian child must not be terminated unless:

(1)   the court is satisfied that active efforts as defined in MCR 3.002 have been made to provide remedial service and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful, and

(2)   the court finds evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of at least one qualified expert witness as described in MCL 712B.17, that parental rights should be terminated because continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian will likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.

(H) Termination of Parental Rights; Other. If the parental rights of a respondent over the child were not terminated pursuant to subrule (E) at the initial dispositional hearing or pursuant to subrule (F) at a hearing on a supplemental petition on the basis of different circumstances, and the child is within the jurisdiction of the court, the court must, if the child is in foster care, or may, if the child is not in foster care, following a dispositional review hearing under MCR 3.975, a progress review under MCR 3.974, or a permanency planning hearing under MCR 3.976, take action on a supplemental petition that seeks to terminate the parental rights of a respondent over the child on the basis of one or more grounds listed in MCL 712A.19b(3).

(1) Time.

(a) Filing Petition. The supplemental petition for termination of parental rights may be filed at any time after the initial dispositional review hearing, progress review, or permanency planning hearing, whichever occurs first.

(b) Hearing on Petition. The hearing on a supplemental petition for termination of parental rights under this subrule must be held within 42 days after the filing of the supplemental petition. The court may, for good cause shown, extend the period for an additional 21 days.

(2) Discovery, Prehearing Disclosures, and Evidence. Parties shall make disclosures as detailed in MCR 3.922(A) at least 21 days prior to the termination hearing and have rights to discovery consistent with that rule. The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply at the hearing, other than those with respect to privileges, except to the extent such privileges are abrogated by MCL 722.631. At the hearing all relevant and material evidence, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value. The parties must be afforded an opportunity to examine and controvert written reports received by the court and shall be allowed to cross-examine individuals who made the reports when those individuals are reasonably available.

(3) Order. The court must order termination of the parental rights of a respondent and must order that additional efforts for reunification of the child with the respondent must not be made, if the court finds

(a) on the basis of clear and convincing evidence admitted pursuant to subrule (H)(2) that one or more facts alleged in the petition:

   (i) are true; and

   (ii) come within MCL 712A.19b(3).

(b) that termination of parental rights is in the child’s best interests.

(I) Findings.

(1) General. The court shall state on the record or in writing its findings of fact and conclusions of law. Brief, definite, and pertinent findings and conclusions on contested matters are sufficient. If the court does not issue a decision on the record following hearing, it shall file its decision within 28 days after the taking of final proofs, but no later than 70 days after the commencement of the hearing to terminate parental rights.

(2) Denial of Termination. If the court finds that the parental rights of respondent should not be terminated, the court must make findings of fact and conclusions of law.

(3) Order of Termination. An order terminating parental rights under the Juvenile Code may not be entered unless the court makes findings of fact, states its conclusions of law, and includes the statutory basis for the order.

(J) Respondent's Rights Following Termination.

(1) Advice. Immediately after entry of an order terminating parental rights, the court shall advise the respondent parent orally or in writing that:

(a) The respondent is entitled to appellate review of the order.

(b) If the respondent is financially unable to provide an attorney to perfect an appeal, the court will appoint an attorney and furnish the attorney with the complete transcript and record of all proceedings.

(c) A request for the assistance of an attorney must be made within 21 days after notice of the order is given or an order is entered denying a timely filed postjudgment motion. The court must then give a form to the respondent with the instructions (to be repeated on the form) that if the respondent desires the appointment of an attorney, the form must be returned to the court within the required period (to be stated on the form).

(d) The respondent has the right to file a denial of release of identifying information, a revocation of a denial of release, and to keep current the respondent's name and address as provided in MCL 710.27.

(e) The respondent's obligation to support the child will continue until a court of competent jurisdiction modifies or terminates the obligation, an order of adoption is entered, or the child is emancipated by operation of law. Failure to provide required notice under this subsection does not affect the obligation imposed by law or otherwise establish a remedy or cause of action on behalf of the parent.

(2) Appointment of Appellate Counsel. Request and appointment of appellate counsel is governed by MCR 3.993.

(K) Review Standard. The clearly erroneous standard shall be used in reviewing the court's findings on appeal from an order terminating parental rights. On application in accordance with Chapter 7 of these rules, the Supreme Court may consider a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and the Court will review such a claim using the standards that apply to criminal law.

Rule 3.978 Post-Termination Review Hearings
(A) Review Hearing Requirement. If a child remains in foster care following the termination of parental rights to the child, the court must conduct a hearing not more than 91 days after the termination of parental rights and not later than every 91 days after that hearing for the first year following the termination of parental rights to the child. At the post-termination review hearing, the court shall review the child's placement in foster care and the progress toward the child's adoption or other permanent placement, as long as the child is subject to the jurisdiction, control, or supervision of the court, or of the Michigan Children's Institute or other agency. If the child is residing in another permanent planned living arrangement or is placed with a fit and willing relative and the child’s placement is intended to be permanent, the court must conduct a hearing not more than 182 days from the preceding review hearing.

(B) Notice; Right to be Heard. The foster parents (if any) of a child and any preadoptive parents or relative providing care to the child must be provided with notice of and an opportunity to be heard at each hearing.

(C) Findings. The court must make findings on whether reasonable efforts have been made to establish permanent placement for the child, and may enter such orders as it considers necessary in the best interests of the child, including appointment of a juvenile guardian pursuant to MCL 712A.19c and MCR 3.979.

(D) Termination of Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the court in the child protective proceeding may terminate when a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order:

   (1) terminating the rights of the entity with legal custody and enters an order placing the child for adoption, or

   (2) appointing a juvenile guardian under MCR 3.979 after conducting a review hearing under subsection (A) of this rule.

Rule 3.979 Juvenile Guardianships
(A) Appointment of Juvenile Guardian; Process. If the court determines at a posttermination review hearing or a permanency planning hearing that it is in the child’s best interests, the court may appoint a juvenile guardian for the child pursuant to MCL 712A.19a or MCL 712A.19c.

   (1) Under MCR 3.979(A), the court shall order the Department of Health and Human Services to:

      (a) conduct a criminal record check and central registry clearance of the residents of the home and submit the results to the court within 7 days; and

      (b) perform a home study with a copy to be submitted to the court within 28 days, unless a home study has been performed within the immediately preceding 365 days, in which case a copy of that home study shall be submitted to the court.

   (2) If a child for whom a juvenile guardianship is proposed is in foster care, the court shall continue the child’s placement and order the information required above about the proposed juvenile guardian. If the information required above has already been provided to the court, the court may issue an order appointing the proposed juvenile guardian pursuant to subrule (B).

   (3) If the parental rights over a child who is the subject of a proposed juvenile guardianship have been terminated, the court shall not appoint a guardian without the written consent of the Michigan Children’s Institute (MCI) superintendent. The court may order the Department of Health and Human Services to seek the consent of the MCI superintendent. The consent must be filed with the court no later than 28 days after the permanency planning hearing or the posttermination review hearing, or such longer time as the court may allow for good cause shown.

      (a) If a person denied consent believes that the decision to withhold consent by the MCI superintendent is arbitrary or capricious, the person may file a motion with the court within 56 days of receipt of the decision to deny consent. A motion under this subsection shall contain information regarding both of the following:

         (i) the specific steps taken by the person or agency to obtain the consent required and the results, if any, and

         (ii) the specific reasons why the person or agency believes that the decision to withhold consent was arbitrary or capricious.

      (b) If a motion is filed alleging that the MCI superintendent’s failure to consent was arbitrary or capricious, the court shall set a hearing date and ensure that notice is provided to the MCI superintendent and all parties entitled to notice under MCR 3.921.

      (c) If a hearing is held and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the decision to withhold consent was arbitrary or capricious, the court may approve the guardianship without the consent of the MCI superintendent.

      The court shall determine the continuing necessity and appropriateness of the child’s placement.

(B)   Order Appointing Juvenile Guardian. After receiving the information ordered by the court under subsection (A)(1), and after finding that appointment of a juvenile guardian is in the child’s best interests, the court may enter an order appointing a juvenile guardian. The order appointing a juvenile guardian shall be on a form approved by the state court administrator. Within 7 days of receiving the information, the court shall enter an order appointing a juvenile guardian or schedule the matter for a hearing. A separate order shall be entered for each child.

   (1)   Acceptance of Appointment. A juvenile guardian appointed by the court shall file an acceptance of appointment with the court on a form approved by the state court administrator. The acceptance shall state, at a minimum, that the juvenile guardian accepts the appointment, submits to personal jurisdiction of the court, will not delegate the juvenile guardian’s authority, and will perform required duties.

   (2)   Letters of Authority. On the filing of the acceptance of appointment, the court shall issue letters of authority on a form approved by the state court administrator. Any restriction or limitation of the powers of the juvenile guardian must be set forth in the letters of authority, including but not limited to, not moving the domicile of the child from the state of Michigan without court approval.

   (3)   Certification. Certification of the letters of authority and a statement that on a given date the letters are in full force and effect may appear on the face of copies furnished to the juvenile guardian or interested persons.

   (4)   Notice. Notice of a proceeding relating to the juvenile guardianship shall be delivered or mailed to the juvenile guardian by first-class mail at the juvenile guardian’s address as listed in the court records and to his or her address as then known to the petitioner. Any notice mailed first class by the court to the juvenile guardian’s last address on file shall be considered notice to the juvenile guardian.

(C)   Court Jurisdiction; Review Hearings; Lawyer- Guardian ad Litem.

   (1) Jurisdiction.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the court’s jurisdiction over a juvenile guardianship shall continue until terminated by court order. The court’s jurisdiction over a juvenile under section 2(b) of the Juvenile Code, MCL 712A.2(b), and the jurisdiction of the MCI under section 3 of 1935 PA 220, MCL 400.203, shall be terminated after the court appoints a juvenile guardian under this section and conducts a review hearing pursuant to MCR 3.975 when parental rights to the child have not been terminated, or a review hearing pursuant to MCR 3.978 when parental rights to the child have been terminated.

(b) Unless terminated by court order, the court’s jurisdiction over a juvenile guardianship ordered under MCL 712A.19a or MCL 712A.19c for a youth 16 years of age or older shall continue until 120 days after the youth’s eighteenth birthday. Upon notice by the Department of Health and Human Services that extended guardianship assistance beyond age 18 will be provided to a youth pursuant to MCL 400.665, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the guardianship until that youth no longer receives extended guardianship assistance.

   (2) Review Hearings. The review hearing following appointment of the juvenile guardian must be conducted within 91 days of the most recent review hearing if it has been one year or less from the date the child was last removed from the home, or within 182 days of the most recent review hearing if it has been more than one year from the date the child was last removed from the home.

   (3) Lawyer-Guardian ad Litem. The appointment of the lawyer-guardian ad litem in the child protective proceeding terminates upon entry of the order terminating the court’s jurisdiction pursuant to MCL 712A.2(b). At any time after a juvenile guardian is appointed, the court may reappoint the lawyer-guardian ad litem or may appoint a new lawyer-guardian ad litem if the court is satisfied that such action is warranted. A lawyer-guardian ad litem appointed under this subrule is subject to the provisions of MCL 712A.17d.

(D)   Court Responsibilities.   

   (1)   Annual Reviews.

   (a) Review on Condition of Child. The court shall conduct an annual review of a juvenile guardianship as to the condition of the child until the child’s eighteenth birthday. The review shall be commenced within 63 days after the anniversary date of the appointment of the guardian. The court may conduct a review of a juvenile guardianship at any time it deems necessary. If the report by the juvenile guardian has not been filed as required by subrule (E)(1), the court shall take appropriate action.

   (b) Review on Extended Guardianship Assistance. If, under subrule (C)(1)(b), the Department of Health and Human Services has notified the court that extended guardianship assistance has been provided to a youth pursuant to MCL 400.665, the court shall conduct an annual review hearing at least once every 12 months thereafter to determine that the guardianship meets the criteria under MCL 400.667. The duty to conduct an annual review hearing on extended guardianship assistance shall discontinue when the youth is no longer eligible for extended guardianship assistance. Notice of the hearing under this subrule shall be sent to the guardian and the youth as provided in MCR 3.920(D)(1).

(i) The hearing conducted under this subrule may be adjourned up to 28 days for good cause shown.

(ii) If requested by the court, the guardian must provide proof at the review hearing that the youth is in compliance with the criteria of MCL 400.667.

(iii) Following a review hearing under this subrule, the court shall issue an order to support its determination and serve the order on the Department of Health and Human Services, the guardian, and the youth.

(c) Termination of Juvenile Guardianship. Upon receipt of notice from the Department of Health and Human Services that it will not continue extended guardianship assistance, the court shall immediately terminate the juvenile guardianship.

   (2)   Investigation. The court shall appoint the Department of Health and Human Services or another person to conduct an investigation of the juvenile guardianship of a child when deemed appropriate by the court or upon petition by the Department of Health and Human Services or an interested person. The investigator shall file a written report with the court within 28 days of such appointment and shall serve it on the other interested parties listed in MCR 3.921(C). The report shall include a recommendation regarding whether the juvenile guardianship should continue or be modified and whether a hearing should be scheduled. If the report recommends modification, the report shall state the nature of the modification.

   (3)   Judicial Action. After informal review of the report provided in subrule (D)(2), the court shall enter an order denying the modification or set a date for a hearing to be held within 28 days.

   (4) Upon notice of a child’s death the court shall enter an order of discharge. The court may schedule a hearing on the matter before entering an order of discharge.

(E)   Duties and Authority of Guardian Appointed to Juvenile Guardianship. A juvenile guardianship approved under these rules is authorized by the Juvenile Code and is distinct from a guardianship authorized under the Estates and Protected Individuals Code.

(B) Custody; Detention. When an officer apprehends a minor in relation to a minor personal protection order pursuant to a court order that specifies that the minor is to be brought directly to court; or when an officer apprehends a minor for an alleged violation of a minor personal protection order without a court order, and either the officer has failed to obtain a written promise from the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian to bring the minor to court, or it appears to the officer that there is a substantial likelihood of retaliation or violation by the minor, the officer shall immediately do the following:

(1) If the whereabouts of the minor's parent or parents, guardian, or custodian is known, inform the minor's parent or parents, guardian, or custodian of the minor's apprehension and of the minor's whereabouts and of the need for the parent or parents, guardian, or custodian to be present at the preliminary hearing;
